While such computational methods could be of added value to the field, the rationale for employing these supervised models harbors some assumptions that deserve further inspection. This paper seeks to specify under which conditions SML could be useful for journalism scholars and where the field stands in exploiting its potential benefits. We start with an introduction to SML and give an overview of its applications within journalism studies. Next, we identify challenges for the field in its adoption of such techniques. These include overstating the time and financial savings caused by automatic coding, neglecting proper sampling methods, the danger of algorithmic determinism and the limited generalizability of predictive modeling across different domains, contexts and time periods. At the same time, we distinguish several opportunities. These include sharing classifiers, standardizing coding schemes and adopting general purpose techniques. Most importantly, in order for SML to contribute to the epistemological advancements in the field, SML could be used to explain how long-standing theories in journalism are changing. In turn, this might help us to disentangle the inner workings of our contemporary complex news ecosystem.","[De Grove, Frederik; Boghe, Kristof; De Marez, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, IMEC, Mict,UGent, Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; IMEC,"De Grove, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Commun Sci, IMEC, Mict,UGent, Ghent, Belgium.",frederik.degrove@ugent.be,,"De Marez, Lieven/0000-0001-7716-4079",,,,70,5,5,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Yet this strength brings challenges, including rifts between diverse subfields. In this study, we illustrate the rich potential of collaborations across subfields. Specifically, we argue that due to often-overlooked epistemological similarities, unsupervised machine learning and grounded theory ethnography subfields are well-suited for an especially enriching collaboration. To demonstrate, a team of computational and ethnographic researchers together applied the analysis of topic model networks approach to ethnographic field notes. We illustrate how the inclusion of the ethnographer in the modeling stages, and of the computational researchers in the analysis stages, led to mutual reflexivity affecting every stage of the study, enabling profound reflections on the technical, conceptual, and theoretical pillars of both subfields. We conclude by discussing the potential future of such collaborative ways of knowing to open doors for cutting-edge interdisciplinary research for the new information era.","[Ophir, Yotam] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Commun, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Walter, Dror] Georgia State Univ, Dept Commun, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Marchant, Eleanor R.] Univ Oxford, Dept Programme Comparat Media Law & Policy, Oxford, England",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Oxford,"Ophir, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Commun, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",yotamoph@buffalo.edu,,"Walter, Dror/0000-0001-9870-998X; Ophir, Yotam/0000-0001-5049-7906",,,,48,2,2,6,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

In 2018, when the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to include the addictive use of digital games (gaming disorder) as a diagnosis in the International Classification of Diseases, the debate reached a new peak. In the current article, we aim to provide insights into the public debate on gaming disorder by examining data from Twitter for 11 months prior to and 8 months after the WHO decision, analyzing the (change in) topics, actors, and sentiment over time. Automated content analysis revealed that the debate is organic and not driven by spam accounts or other overly active 'power users.' The WHO announcement had a major impact on the debate, moving it away from the topics of parenting and child welfare, largely by activating actors from gaming culture. The WHO decision also resulted in a major backlash, increasing negative sentiments within the debate.","[Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim; Janzik, Robin; Reer, Felix; Boberg, Svenja; Quandt, Thorsten] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Schatto-Eckrodt, T (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Dept Commun, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",tim.schatto-eckrodt@uni-muenster.de; robin.janzik@uni-muenster.de; felix.reer@uni-muenster.de; svenja.boberg@uni-muenster.de; thorsten.quandt@uni-muenster.de,"Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim/AAD-5004-2022; Quandt, Thorsten/ABE-4668-2021","Quandt, Thorsten/0000-0003-1937-0282; Schatto-Eckrodt, Tim/0000-0003-1658-4373; Janzik, Robin/0000-0001-8100-5791",German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF); University of Munster,The research was funded in part by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

Every event tests people's ability to cope with meteorological disasters and generates the need for disaster risk research and assessments. Social vulnerability is an important measure of disaster risk assessments. Social vulnerability assessment problem can be viewed as a multi-criteria decision-making problem. In order to satisfy the perception of special disaster bearers, we need a local-context approach to construct a social vulnerability evaluation index system. The key to this approach is to identify the evaluation criteria structure by analyzing the complicated information gathering from special disaster bearers. It's natural to use fuzzy language to express disaster bearers' preferences in a complicated context. This paper attempts to describe the interrelationship between the evaluation factors with linguistic preferences since linguistic variables can better reflect the vagueness of human being. The fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) approach has been employed to develop the structural relationship between social vulnerability evaluation factors. In FISM, we apply some computational models of computing with words to quantify the fuzzy interrelationship. Finally, we give an example to show the process of our method.","[Cai, Mei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster KLME, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Mei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Mei] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Wei, Guo] Univ North Carolina Pembroke, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Pembroke, NC 28372 USA",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; University of North Carolina,"Cai, M (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster KLME, Minist Educ, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Cai, M (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Cai, M (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",caimei@nuist.edu.cn,,"cai, mei/0000-0001-9648-0878","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71871121, 2020xtzx002]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71871121) and Foundation of CIC-FEMD the special topic the influence of weather conditions on the spread of large-scale influenza virus (No. 2020xtzx002).,,39,1,1,5,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

This approach considers narratives in terms of a network of dynamically evolving relationships between characters. We apply this method in order to analyze 894 movie scripts encompassing 82,195 scenes, showing that scenes containing moral conflict between central characters can be identified using changes in connectivity patterns between network modules. Furthermore, we derive computational models for standardizing moral conflict measurements. Our results suggest that this method can accurately extract moral conflict from a diverse collection of movie scripts. We provide a theoretical integration of our method into the larger milieu of storytelling and entertainment research, illuminating future research trajectories at the intersection of computational communication research and media psychology.","[Hopp, Frederic Rene; Fisher, Jacob Taylor; Weber, Rene] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Media Neurosci Lab, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Weber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Media Neurosci Lab, Dept Commun, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",fhopp@ucsb.edu; jacobtfisher@ucsb.edu; renew@ucsb.edu,,"Weber, Rene/0000-0002-8247-7341",John Templeton Foundation [61292],"Contract grant sponsors: John Templeton Foundation (to R.W.), contract grant number: 61292.

This study offers a multimethod approach that uses an abductive framework to combine techniques from computational text analysis and network modeling along with interpretive coding. I demonstrate this approach in the context of framing disputes through legal mobilization over the same-sex marriage in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges.

This renders algorithmic content curation with much societal relevance and highlights the urgent need for independent and resilient academic research. Therefore, a plethora of methodological approaches have been applied, such as case studies, expert interviews, observations, or agent-based approaches. The paper discusses the applicability of these methodological efforts for journalism studies, showing that all of these approaches face their limitations, especially with regard to external validity, recruitment difficulties, and data reliability. Thereby, agent-based testing represents one of the most promising approaches to overcome plenty of these methodological limitations. Agent-based testing is a systematic and experimental approach that emulates online human behavior to test algorithmically curated media environments under various conditions. For this to be achieved properly, this paper suggests a multitude of settings and requirements to adequately face the technological, legal, and ethical challenges, which come with the empirical investigation of algorithmic content curation. Ultimately, the paper presents both general considerations and practical instructions (using the ScrapeBot) to employ agent-based testing for journalism studies.","[Haim, Mario] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Haim, M (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway.",mario.haim@uis.no,,,,,,42,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

J,"Dhiman, A; Toshniwal, D",,,,"Dhiman, Aarzoo; Toshniwal, Durga",,偏技术,An Approximate Model for Event Detection From Twitter Data,IEEE ACCESS,,,,,,,,,,,,"The abundance and real-time availability of Twitter data have proved beneficial in detecting events in various domains such as emergency situations, crime detection, public health, place recommendations, etc. Nevertheless, two critical challenges occur while detecting events using social media data. First, the uncertainty in capturing the contextual relationship among tweets, which is the result of the limited availability of the contextual information due to the small length of tweets. Second, the high computation cost required in event detection due to massive data processing. Earlier research works, addressing these challenges, have tried to capture the contextual information by using the dense vector representations of texts leveraging deep neural word embedding generation models such as Word2Vec and GloVe. However, these models are trained on the Euclidean vector space which fails to amalgamate the directional information of the vectors with the semantic information in text, incurring high computational costs. To target both the problems simultaneously, we propose modeling Twitter data as a graph-of-sentences which retains the contextual relationships while maintaining lower computational cost. The proposed model captures contextual information using JoSE, a spherical vector representation leveraging the word-word and word-paragraph semantic co-occurrence statistics in a spherical generative model. Furthermore, the framework uses the weighted-graph model to capture all the relationships among the Twitter data efficiently. The graph is further pruned with the help of the graph component filtering approach. The graph clustering model, employed to detect the events, leverages the edge weights and the partial-k clustering approach maintaining low computation costs. The experimentation on the annotated benchmark Twitter data set and the real-world datasets show improved run-time performance up to 30% while maintaining the qualitative performance (F1-score) comparable to the state-of-the-art models.","[Dhiman, Aarzoo; Toshniwal, Durga] IIT Roorkee, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Roorkee,"Dhiman, A (通讯作者)，IIT Roorkee, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Roorkee 247667, Uttar Pradesh, India.",aarzoo@cs.iitr.ac.in,,,"University Grant Commission (UGC), Government of IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India","This work was supported by the University Grant Commission (UGC), Government of India.",,52,5,5,3,7,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,122168,122184,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007004,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MR7GJ,WOS:000553759200001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for each of the corpora. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the conspiracy theorists' interpretation of hidden knowledge to link otherwise unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. We contrast this to the single domain focus of an actual conspiracy. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the narrative framework of an actual conspiracy, which might develop more slowly as revelations come to light. By highlighting the structural differences between the two narrative frameworks, our approach could be used by private and public analysts to help distinguish between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.","[Tangherlini, Timothy R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Scandinavian Sect, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Shahsavari, Shadi; Shahbazi, Behnam; Ebrahimzadeh, Ehsan; Roychowdhury, Vwani] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Tangherlini, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Scandinavian Sect, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",tango@g.ucla.edu,"Shahsavari, Shadi/AAV-2978-2020","Shahbazi, Behnam/0000-0001-6467-8409; Tangherlini, Timothy/0000-0002-1775-2052",,,,105,15,15,3,8,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,44728,2020,15,6,,,,,,,e0233879,10.1371/journal.pone.0233879,,,39,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MB9ZQ,WOS:000542957200012,32544200,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing usage of social media has led to an increase in the number of people who can be influenced, thus the spread of fake news can potentially impact important events. Fake news has become a major societal issue and a technical challenge for social media companies to identify and has led many to extreme measures, such as WhatsApp deleting two million of its users every month to prevent the spread of fake news. The current problem of fake news is rooted in the historical problem of disinformation, which is false information intentionally, and usually clandestinely, disseminated to manipulate public opinion or obfuscate the truth.

Using parameters informed by empirical evidence, we computationally modeled these cross-cultural differences to predict two forms of cultural change: consolidation of opinion majorities into stronger majorities, and the spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Results obtained from more than 300,000 computer simulations showed that in populations characterized by greater susceptibility to social influence, there was more rapid consolidation of majority opinion and also more successful spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Initially unpopular beliefs also spread more readily in populations characterized by less densely connected social networks. These computational outputs highlight the value of computational modeling methods as a means to specify hypotheses about specific ways in which cross-cultural differences may have long-term consequences for cultural stability and cultural change.","[Schaller, Mark] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Muthukrishna, Michael] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of British Columbia; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Muthukrishna, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Psychol & Behav Sci, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.muthukrishna@lse.ac.uk,"Muthukrishna, Michael/Z-1655-2019","Muthukrishna, Michael/0000-0002-7079-5166",,,,98,23,23,7,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1088-8683,1532-7957,,PERS SOC PSYCHOL REV,Pers.

However, questions remain whether we are moving towards convergence within the sub-disciplines of communication and with other disciplines in OSN research. This article pursues two interrelated goals. First, it performs a bibliometric analysis of existing scholarship on OSNs in the past 20 years, highlighting both the convergence and divergence of inquiry on OSNs in computer-mediated communication (CMC) research. Second, based on the results of the bibliometric analysis, it articulates an agenda for future CMC research. Specifically, we advocate for a social network approach that will bridge various theoretical frameworks and disciplinary/sub-disciplinary boundaries, for employing the communication network taxonomy, for greater effort to integrate traditional and computational approaches within and beyond social network analysis, and for addressing a greater diversity of institutional contexts.","[Fu, Jiawei Sophia] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Lai, Chih-Hui] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Dept Commun & Technol, Hsinchu 302, Hsinchu County, Taiwan",Rutgers State University New Brunswick; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Fu, JWS (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Commun, Sch Commun & Informat, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",sophia.fu@rutgers.edu,"Lai, Chih-Hui/AAK-9980-2021","Lai, Chih-Hui/0000-0001-8060-6114",School of Communication and Information at RutgersUniversity,"This project was partially supported through the first author's startup funding fromthe School of Communication and Information at RutgersUniversity.

Though a growing number of studies analyze the strategy of such campaigns, it is not yet known how these efforts shaped the political attitudes and behaviors of Americans. We study this question using longitudinal data that describe the attitudes and online behaviors of 1,239 Republican and Democratic Twitter users from late 2017 merged with nonpublic data about the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA) from Twitter. Using Bayesian regression tree models, we find no evidence that interaction with IRA accounts substantially impacted 6 distinctive measures of political attitudes and behaviors over a 1-mo period. We also find that interaction with IRA accounts were most common among respondents with strong ideological homophily within their Twitter network, high interest in politics, and high frequency of Twitter usage. Together, these findings suggest that Russian trolls might have failed to sow discord because they mostly interacted with those who were already highly polarized. We conclude by discussing several important limitations of our study-especially our inability to determine whether IRA accounts influenced the 2016 presidential election-as well as its implications for future research on social media influence campaigns, political polarization, and computational social science.","[Bail, Christopher A.; Guay, Brian; Maloney, Emily; Combs, Aidan; Hillygus, D.

Evaluating the Intersection of Automated Journalism and Journalistic Role Conceptions,MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION,,,,,,,,,,,COMPUTATIONAL JOURNALISM; NEWS; MACHINES,"Newsrooms are a social context in which numerous relationships exist and influence news work-be it with other journalists, the audience, and technology. As some of these relations change due to technological innovations, new hybrid contexts-technologies that are interwoven with newsroom values, routines, and socio-cultural experiences-can emerge. One key question is how journalists conceptualise and interact with such technologies, and to what degree they retain (creative) agency in the process. Therefore, this study evaluates the intersection of automated journalism and journalistic role conceptions. Using Hanitzsch's and Vos's circular model of journalistic roles (2017) and Deuze's understanding of journalism as an ideology (2005) as a theoretical framework, this study examines some of the discursive aspects of automated journalism by asking: To what extent are journalistic roles (a) challenged or (b) advanced as a result of automated journalism? Our findings more closely align with the latter, pointing to a strong sense of discursive maintenance of journalists' roles and their core skillset and thus suggesting a high degree of ideological continuity in the face of industrial disruption. It concludes with an agenda for future research and stresses that at times when journalism and automation intersect, the field would benefit from incorporating emerging conceptual frameworks such as human-machine communication.","[Schapals, Aljosha Karim] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia; [Porlezza, Colin] Univ London, Sch Arts & Social Sci, Dept Journalism, London EC1V 0HB, England",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of London,"Schapals, AK (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia.",aljosha.schapals@qut.edu.au; colin.porlezza@city.ac.uk,,"Schapals, Aljosha Karim/0000-0001-9512-8792; Porlezza, Colin/0000-0002-1400-5879",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP160101211],The research was supported by a research grant from the Australian Research Council [grant number DP160101211].,,42,10,10,3,12,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2020,8,3,,,,,16,26,,10.17645/mac.v8i3.2020,,,11,Communication,,Communication,ML6KR,WOS:000549573000003,,,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Taking the COVID-19 pandemic as an example, this paper explores the impact of panic in uncertain environments on panic buying behavior. Under certain circumstances, the spread of rumors about shortage of goods is likely to cause large-scale panic buying. This paper focuses on the study of such panic buying caused by online rumors. Methods: Firstly, based on the improved BA network, this paper constructs a directed network for public opinion communication and integrates an offline communication network to build a two-layer synchronous coupling network based on online and offline communications. Secondly, the individual decision model and the panic emotion transmission model under the uncertain environment are constructed. Netizens judge the authenticity of network information, determine their own panic degree according to the above two models, and judge whether they participate in the panic buying based on the above factors. Finally, the spread of the public opinion of goods buying under the panic state is simulated and analyzed. Results: The experimental results of the two-layer synchronous network that integrates offline interaction are significantly different from the results of pure online interaction, which increases the speed of public opinions spread after offline interaction and affects a wider range of groups. Under the condition of sufficient supplies, panic in local areas will not cause large-scale panic buying on the whole network. However, the results under the same parameters suggest that if there is a shortage of supplies, panic will spread quickly across the network, leading to large-scale panic buying. It is very important to ensure sufficient supply of materials at the beginning of the spread of rumors, which can reduce the number of buyers. However, if there is a shortage of goods before the panic dissipates in the later stage, there will still be a large-scale rush purchase. Conclusion: These results explain the reasons why it is difficult to stop the buying events in many areas under the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the uncertain environment, the panic caused by people's fear of stock shortage promotes the occurrence of large-scale rush buying. Therefore, in the event of major public health events, ensuring adequate supply of materials is the top priority.","[Li, Qianqian] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Management & Business, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tinggui] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Yang, Jianjun] Univ North Georgia, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Oakwood, GA 30566 USA; [Cong, Guodong] Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Gongshang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University; Zhejiang Gongshang University,"Chen, TG (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Gongshang Univ, Sch Stat & Math, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",ctgsimon@mail.zjgsu.edu.cn,,"Li, Qianqian/0000-0002-3566-5008",National Social Science Foundation of China [20BTQ059],This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 20BTQ059).,,42,9,9,17,28,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1179-1578,,,PSYCHOL RES BEHAV MA,Psychol.

Based on 33,752 Instagram posts, we develop a deep learning-based, classification model merged with three modalities-image (i.e., VGG16 feature and gesture), text (i.e., linguistic, tag, sentence, and category), and activity (i.e., reply and day). Our model achieves a better performance in classifying three gender types in the male, female, and male + female cases than the traditional machine learning models.

Our study aims to define relational structures in a Big Data set, implementing measurements and clustering methods by Network Analysis in order to build decision-making indicators. We describe an audience model both to collect a large amount of online data from large online newspapers and to structure those in a relational form. By analysing readers' comments, we can derive proxies of reliable indicators about specific topics discussed on an online newspaper blog. We show the effectiveness of such an approach in detecting and building indicators to support policy-makers in complex decision-making processes.","[Tomaselli, Venera; Giuffrida, Giovanni; Gozzo, Simona; Rinaldi, Francesco Mazzeo] Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, 8 Vittorio Emanuele II, I-95131 Catania, Italy; [Rinaldi, Francesco Mazzeo] Royal Inst Technol, Sch Architecture & Built Environm, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Catania; Royal Institute of Technology,"Tomaselli, V (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Polit & Social Sci, 8 Vittorio Emanuele II, I-95131 Catania, Italy.",venera.tomaselli@unict.it,,"Tomaselli, Venera/0000-0002-2287-7343",,,,44,0,0,1,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

However, harvesting and analyzing the sheer overload of data that is produced by these media poses immense challenges to journalists, researchers, activists, policy makers, and concerned citizens. To mitigate this situation, this article discusses the creation of (social) media observatories: platforms that enable users to capture the complexities of social behavior, in particular the alignment and misalignment of opinions, through computational analyses of digital media data. The article positions the concept of observatories for social media monitoring among ongoing methodological developments in the computational social sciences and humanities and proceeds to discuss the technological innovations and design choices behind social media observatories currently under development for the study of opinions related to cultural and societal issues in European spaces. Notable attention is devoted to the construction of Penelope: an open, web-services-based infrastructure that allows different user groups to consult and contribute digital tools and observatories that suit their analytical needs. The potential and the limitations of this approach are discussed on the basis of a climate change opinion observatory that implements text analysis tools to study opinion dynamics concerning themes such as global warming. Throughout, the article explicitly acknowledges and addresses potential risks of the machine-guided and human-incentivized study of opinion dynamics. Concluding remarks are devoted to a synthesis of the ethical and epistemological implications of the exercise of positioning observatories in contemporary information spaces and to an examination of future pathways for the development of social media observatories.","[Willaert, Tom] Vrije Univ Brussel, Artificial Intelligence Lab, Brussels, Belgium; [Van Eecke, Paul; Beuls, Katrien] Vrije Univ Brussel, Artificial Intelligence, Brussels, Belgium; [Steels, Luc] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Venice, Italy",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Willaert, T (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, Artificial Intelligence Lab, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",tom@ai.vub.ac.be,"Van Eecke, Paul/AAR-1638-2021","Van Eecke, Paul/0000-0001-9153-9092; Beuls, Katrien/0000-0003-4451-4778; Willaert, Tom/0000-0002-3879-6767",European UnionEuropean Commission [732942],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 732942.",,49,4,4,6,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

For professional journalists, the use of social media for news production creates new challenges for the verification process. This article describes the development and evaluation of the 'Truthmeter' - a tool that automatically scores the journalistic credibility of social media contributors in order to inform overall credibility assessments. The Truthmeter was evaluated using a three-stage process that used both qualitative and quantitative methods, consisting of (1) obtaining a ground truth, (2) building a description of existing practices and (3) calibration, modification and testing. As a result of the evaluation process, which could be generalized and applied in other contexts, the Truthmeter produced credibility scores that were closely aligned with those of trainee journalists. Substantively, the evaluation also highlighted the importance of 'relational' credibility assessments, where credibility may be attributed based on networked connections to other credible contributors.","[Fletcher, Richard] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, Oxford, England; [Schifferes, Steve] City Univ London, Financial Journalism, London, England; [Thurman, Neil] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich, Germany",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; City University London; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Munich,"Thurman, N (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Inst Commun Studies & Media Res, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",neil.thurman@ifkw.lmu.de,"Fletcher, Richard/V-4402-2019","Thurman, Neil/0000-0003-3909-9565",,,,33,14,14,1,37,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1354-8565,1748-7382,,CONVERGENCE-US,Convergence,FEB,2020,26,1,,,,,19,34,,10.1177/1354856517714955,,,16,Communication,,Communication,KH0KH,WOS:000510336400002,,"Green Published, Green Accepted",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

This complexity calls for a comprehensive analytical approach that would allow for understanding of various dimensions of learner generated discourse and the structure of the underlying social interactions. Current research, however, primarily focuses on manual or, more recently, supervised methods for discourse analysis. Moreover, discourse and social structures are typically analyzed separately without the use of computational methods that can offer a holistic perspective. This paper proposes an approach that addresses these two challenges, first, by using an unsupervised machine learning approach to extract speech acts as representations of knowledge construction processes and finds transition probabilities between speech acts across different messages, and second, by integrating the use of discovered speech acts to explain the formation of social ties and predicting course outcomes. We extracted six categories of speech acts from messages exchanged in discussion forums of two MOOCs and each category corresponded to knowledge construction processes from well-established theoretical models. We further showed how measures derived from discourse analysis explained the ways how social ties were created that framed emerging social networks. Multiple regression models showed that the combined use of measures derived from discourse analysis and social ties predicted learning outcomes.","[Joksimovic, Srecko; Kovanovic, Vitomir] Univ South Australia, Teaching Innovat Unit, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Joksimovic, Srecko; Kovanovic, Vitomir] Univ South Australia, Sch Educ, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Jovanovic, Jelena; Milikic, Nikola] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Gasevic, Dragan] Monash Univ, Fac Educ, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Zouaq, Amal] Univ Ottawa, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Van Staalduinen, Jan Paul] Delft Univ Technol, Extens Sch, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",University of South Australia; University of South Australia; University of Belgrade; Monash University; University of Ottawa; Delft University of Technology,"Joksimovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Teaching Innovat Unit, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.; Joksimovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ South Australia, Sch Educ, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",srecko.joksimovic@unisa.edu.au; jeljov@gmail.com; vitomir.kovanovis@unisa.edu.au; dragan.gascvic@monash.edu; nikola.milikic@gmail.com; azouaq@uOttawa.ca; J.P.vanStaalduinen@tudelft.nl,"Kovanovic, Vitomir/F-5862-2017; Joksimovic, Srecko/R-3093-2019; Gasevic, Dragan/AAT-3909-2020; Jovanovic, Jelena/AAL-1835-2021","Kovanovic, Vitomir/0000-0001-9694-6033; Joksimovic, Srecko/0000-0001-6999-3547; Gasevic, Dragan/0000-0001-9265-1908; Jovanovic, Jelena/0000-0002-1904-0446",,,,66,3,3,2,13,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",1939-1382,,,IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL,IEEE Trans.

Previous work in this area has been concentrated on prototyping CND tools, which can, for instance, send alerts and leads to journalists about social media events, documents of interest, or salient patterns in streams of data. This article describes a qualitative interview study of journalists as they incorporate CND tools into their practices. Findings provide insights into how CND tools interact with the internal attention economy and sociotechnical gatekeeping processes of the newsroom and how future CND tools might better align with necessary journalistic evaluations of newsworthiness and quality, while ensuring configurability, human agency, and flexible applicability to a wide range of use cases. These findings begin to outline a conceptual framework that can help guide the effective design of future CND tools.","[Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Diakopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nad@northwestern.edu,,"Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-1845460],This work was supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under grant IIS-1845460.,,63,7,7,3,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article showcases computational approaches to text analysis (specifically so-called topic models) to diachronically investigate nativist right-wing issues in social media by comparing comments posted on the Facebook page of the Pegida movement to those of the Alternative for Germany. After describing topic modelling as an increasingly popular method and drawing on the literature on right-wing nativism online, we investigate a set of shared issues relevant to the mobilization of commentators, including opposition to Islam, migration, the government and the media. We furthermore show contrastively how issue prevalence differs between the two groups, and how issue shares change over time, in some instances converging on a shared nativist core. We close with a series of suggestions on the utility of computation content analysis for the study of rapidly evolving political agendas.","[Puschmann, Cornelius] Univ Bremen, ZeMKI, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Ausserhofer, Julian] Alexander von Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany; [Slerka, Josef] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Bremen; Charles University Prague,"Puschmann, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, ZeMKI, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",c.puschmann@leibniz-hbi.de,"Slerka, Josef/AAK-6974-2021",,European Regional Development Fund-Project Creativity and Adaptability as Conditions of the Success of Europe in an Interrelated World [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000734],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund-Project Creativity and Adaptability as Conditions of the Success of Europe in an Interrelated World (No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000734).",,51,2,2,3,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-3231,1460-3705,,EUR J COMMUN,Eur.

This study analyzes the linking practices of U.S. presidential candidates running in the 2016 election. Using exploratory data analysis and confirmatory tests of hyperlinked domains, we find that presidential candidates curate information flows that are distinct by party and even within party. Though candidates in both parties share a common set of links primarily via mainstream media outlets, Republican candidates also link to a set of news and information sites that their Democratic counterparts do not link to, and vice versa. Republican candidates have distinct hyperlinking practices during the surfacing and primary stages of the election cycle relative to other Republican candidates, suggesting that just as candidates differentiate themselves in terms of issue ownership, they also do so in terms of information ownership.

Digital propaganda refers to the use of machines in addition to human users to interact with humans or run a campaign on the internet, computer and mobile devices designed to deliberately manipulate public opinion during crises or elections. While developing countries continue to have a limited internet base, this has not deterred political actors from integrating the internet into their propaganda strategies. Using Twitter data on two international conflicts between India and Pakistan - the Uri attack and the subsequent Surgical Strike - I show how online public opinion has been manipulated by a handful of sources that are driven by algorithms. Online public opinion has been able to enter the offline domain because of the contextual hybridity and the emergence of a hybrid media system. These findings reflect the limitations of public opinion in the digital age, and call attention to political polarization in the country.

The diffusion of each tweet message was tracked for six days following its publication. The results showed that tweets with severity, efficacy, and call-for-action information achieved greater diffusion sizes and faster speed. Negative emotional words drove the information to spread widely and quickly, while positive emotional words suppressed the diffusion. Tweet messages with less affiliative words were linked to a larger size and faster speed. The study adds new insights into the dynamic processes of information diffusion and provides practical guidance to promote widespread and fast diffusion on social media.","[Zhu, Xun; Park, Haseon] Univ North Dakota, Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Commun, Grand Forks, ND USA; [Kim, Youllee] Penn State Univ, Coll Liberal Arts, Dept Commun Arts & Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Zhu, X (通讯作者)，Univ North Dakota, 501 N Columbia Rd,Stop 7169, Grand Forks, ND 58203 USA.",xun.zhu@und.edu,,"Kim, Youllee/0000-0001-9843-5712; Park, Haseon/0000-0002-7561-706X; Zhu, Xun/0000-0003-1000-8324",,,,70,12,13,5,50,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

However, the role of these peaks in emergencies is still unclear. In this article, we try to disentangle this problem and investigate the effect of these peaks on the lifecycle and influence of online emergency information dissemination. We first propose an Online Emergency Information Dissemination Process (OEIDP) model drawing from the ideas of system cybernetics and system identification to present the emergency lifecycle with a decay parameter, time constant, and delay parameter. Based on this model, we then analyze the effect of peaks using empirical data from the Weibo, WeChat, and 20000 media platforms of 169 emergencies. The results reveal the positive significant impacts of the peak time, peak volume, and spikes on emergency information dissemination. The results enable us to make accurate judgements when facing peaks and remind us of the need to balance the strongest manifestation and final influence. Our work complements the gaps on the peak effect in the existing communication literature and introduces the concept of system cybernetics to solve information dissemination which provides a new direction for future studies to solve related problems using system control techniques.","[Yu, Yongtian; Yu, Guang; Li, Tong; Ma, Ning] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Zhiwei] Zhiwei Data Co, Dept Algorithm & Programming, Ningbo 315000, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Yu, G (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",yug@hit.edu.cn,,"Ma, Ning/0000-0002-7985-5030","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71531013, 71774041]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71531013 and Grant 71774041, and in part by the data support from Zhiwei Company.",,25,0,0,7,15,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,132841,132849,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010526,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MS6EX,WOS:000554367800001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Interviews with data journalists and editors suggest that professional routines resonate with established data journalism epistemologies, values, and norms that appear to be constitutional for an inter-organisational data journalism subculture. At the same time, organisational structure either integrates the journalistic subculture by increasing levels of complexity, formalisation, and centralisation or rejects it by not accommodating it structurally or culturally. The three data teams work along epistemologies of computer-assisted reporting, investigative journalism, and data journalism but differentiate themselves through nuanced understandings of data journalism practice, driven by individual journalists. After a structureless episode, one team sets itself apart as it diverges from data-driven routines and orients itself towards technological and interdisciplinary interactive journalism. The findings show an interdependence of individual efforts, varying conceptualisations of data journalism practice, and interplay between organisational structure and professional culture.","[Stalph, Florian] Univ Passau, Ctr Media & Commun, Journalism Studies, Innstr 33a, D-94032 Passau, Germany",University of Passau,"Stalph, F (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Ctr Media & Commun, Journalism Studies, Innstr 33a, D-94032 Passau, Germany.",florian.stalph@uni-passau.de,,"Stalph, Florian/0000-0003-4018-0918",,,,58,5,5,4,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JAN,2020,7,1,,,,,,,2.054E+15,10.1177/2053951720919964,,,13,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,LH1QP,WOS:000528564200001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

This has spurred researchers to explore the effects of this monetization strategy on players' game enjoyment and intention to continue using the game. Hitherto, these relationships were exclusively investigated using cross-sectional survey designs. However, self-report measures tend to be only mildly correlated with actual media consumption. Moreover, cross-sectional designs do not allow for a detailed investigation into the temporal dimension of these associations. To address these issues, the current study leverages smartphone trace data to explore the longitudinal effect of in-game purchase behavior on continual mobile game use. In total, approximately 100,000 hours of mobile game activity among 6,340 subjects were analyzed. A Cox regression with time-dependent covariates was performed to examine whether performing in-game purchases affects the risk of players removing the game app from their repertoire. Results show that making an in-game purchase decreases this risk initially, prolonging the survival time of the mobile gaming app. However, this effect significantly changes over time. After the first three weeks, a reversal effect is found where previous in-game purchase behavior negatively affects the further survival of the game. Thus, mobile games without previous monetary investment are more prone to long-term continual game use if they survive the first initial weeks. Methodological and theoretical implications are discussed. As such, the current study adds to those studies that use computational methods within a traditional inferential framework to aid theory-driven inquiries.","[Boghe, Kristof; De Grove, Frederik; Van Gaeveren, Kyle; De Marez, Lieven] Univ Ghent, Imec Mict UGent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Herrewijn, Laura] Univ Ghent, Ctr Persuas Commun, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University,"Boghe, K (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Imec Mict UGent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",kboghe@gmail.com; laura.herrewijn@ugent.be; frederik.degrove@gmail.com; kyle.vangaeveren@ugent.be; lieven.demarez@ugent.be,,"Van Gaeveren, Kyle/0000-0003-1002-8341",Mobile DNA Project of the imec-mict-UGent Research Group,We would like to thank the reviewers and the editors for their valuable comments and suggestions.

This article looks at a case study from India and aims to characterize the participation of women in research, by analysing the parameters of institution-type, discipline, citation impact and international collaboration. Research publication data from 50 most productive Indian institutions, along with data for 5 major institution systems, for a period of 10 years (2008-2017), as indexed in Web of Science, is obtained as sample data and analysed. Results obtained show that participation of women is found to vary in different disciplines, with biology (37%), agriculture science (32%), social science (31%) and medical science (32%) having relatively higher number of female 1st authored papers as compared to engineering (20%), information science (21%) and mathematics (22%). It is also observed that institutions specializing in medical sciences and social science have relatively better participation of women. In terms of location of institution in a big metropolitan city or an urban area, it was found that there do not exist any significant differentiation in levels of participation of women in research between institutions located in bigger cities or smaller towns. Further, analysis of citation and collaboration patterns show that though male authored papers have an edge in citation impact, women researchers get more internationally collaborated papers.","[Paswan, Jyoti] Banaras Hindu Univ, DST CIMS, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Singh, Vivek Kumar] Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India",Banaras Hindu University (BHU); Banaras Hindu University (BHU),"Singh, VK (通讯作者)，Banaras Hindu Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Varanasi 221005, Uttar Pradesh, India.",jyoti.paswan01@bhu.ac.in; vivek@bhu.ac.in,"Singh, Vivek/O-5699-2019","singh, vivek kumar/0000-0002-7348-6545; Paswan, Jyoti/0000-0002-4241-344X",DST-NSTMIS [DST/NSTMIS/05/04/2019-20],"The authors acknowledge the enabling support provided by the DST-NSTMIS funded project 'Design of a Computational Framework for Discipline-wise and Thematic Mapping of Research Performance of Indian Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)', bearing National Science and Technology Management Information System (Grant No. DST/NSTMIS/05/04/2019-20), for this work.",,40,3,3,5,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,1588-2861,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,APR,2020,123,1,,,,,497,515,,10.1007/s11192-020-03398-5,,43862,19,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,KX4HZ,WOS:000516437800004,,,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we systematically examine the consequences of imprisoning well-known Saudis for online dissent by analyzing over 300 million tweets as well as detailed Google search data from 2010 to 2017 using automated text analysis and crowd-sourced human evaluation of content. We find that repression deterred imprisoned Saudis from continuing to dissent online. However, it did not suppress dissent overall. Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for regime change. Repression drew public attention to arrested Saudis and their causes, and other prominent figures in Saudi Arabia were not deterred by the repression of their peers and continued to dissent online.","[Pan, Jennifer] Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Siegel, Alexandra A.] Stanford Univ, Immigrat Policy Lab, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Pan, J (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Commun, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",jp1@stanford.edu; aasiegel@stanford.edu,"Siegel, Alexandra A./M-1331-2019","Siegel, Alexandra A./0000-0003-0792-7813; Pan, Jennifer/0000-0002-4818-0122",Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1647450],"Our thanks to Charles Crabtree, Killian Clarke, Christian Davenport, Martin Dimitrov, Jennifer Earl, Will Hobbs, Holger Kern, Beatriz Magaloni, Elizabeth Nugent, Molly Roberts, Arturas Rozenas, Anton Sobolev, Rory Truex, Lauren Young, Zachary SteinertThrelkeld, and participants at the 2018 APSA pre-conference on politics and computational social science for their helpful comments and suggestions; to SMaPP Global for making our collaboration possible; to the Stanford King Center on Global Poverty and Development and the National Science Foundation (Award #1647450) for research support.

Because of the KOLs' unique capability to draw specific types of audience and cultivate long-term relationship with them, correctly identifying the most suitable KOLs within a social network is of great importance, and sometimes could govern the success or failure of a brand's online marketing campaigns. However, given the high dimensionality of social media data, conducting effective KOL identification by means of data mining is especially challenging. Owing to the generally multiple modalities of the user profiles and user-generated content (UGC) over the social networks, we can approach the KOL identification process as a multimodal learning task, with KOLs as a rare yet far more important class over non-KOLs in our consideration. In this regard, learning the compact and informative representation from the high-dimensional multimodal space is crucial in KOL identification. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning algorithm dubbed modality-consistent harmonized discriminant embedding (MCHDE) to uncover the low-dimensional discriminative representation from the social media data for identifying KOLs. Specifically, MCHDE aims to find a common subspace for multiple modalities, in which the local geometric structure, the harmonized discriminant information, and the modality consistency of the dataset could be preserved simultaneously. The above objective is then formulated as a generalized eigendecomposition problem and the closed-form solution is obtained. Experiments on both synthetic example and a real-world KOL dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","[Liu, Yang; Gu, Zhonglei; Liu, Jiming] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yang; Liu, Jiming] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Inst Res & Continuing Educ, Shenzhen 518057, Peoples R China; [Ko, Tobey H.] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Hong Kong,"Liu, Y (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",csygliu@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; cszlgu@comp.hkbu.edu.hk; tobeyko@hku.hk; jiming@comp.hkbu.edu.hk,,"Liu, Jiming/0000-0002-8669-9064",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61503317]; General Research Fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR [HKBU12202417]; SZSTI [JCYJ20170307161544087],"This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61503317, in part by the General Research Fund from the Research Grant Council of Hong Kong SAR under Project HKBU12202417, and in part by the SZSTI Grant under Project JCYJ20170307161544087.",,49,7,7,12,89,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2168-2267,2168-2275,,IEEE T CYBERNETICS,IEEE T.

In this study, we conceived of teacher-focused hashtags as affinity spaces potentially containing subspaces distinguished by synchronous chats and other, asynchronous communication. We used computational methods to explore how participation differed in terms of content, interactions, and portals between these contexts within the #michED hashtag used by Michigan teachers. During the 2015-2016 academic year, #michED saw more non-chat activity than chat activity, and most participants only engaged in one mode of activity or the other. Participation during chats was associated with more replying as well as more socially-, affectively-, and cognitively-related content, suggesting a focus on social interaction. In contrast, non-chat participation was associated with more retweeting, mentioning, hyperlinks, and hashtags, suggesting a focus on content dissemination. These results suggest that different affinity spaces-and different literacy practices-may exist within the same hashtag to support different objectives. Teachers, teacher educators, and researchers should therefore be careful to make these distinctions when considering Twitter as a learning technology for teachers.","[Greenhalgh, Spencer P.] Univ Kentucky, Sch Informat Sci, 859-218-2294,320 Lucille Little Fine Arts Lib, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; [Rosenberg, Joshua M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Theory & Practice Teacher Educ, Knoxville, TN USA; [Willet, K.

Using computational data collected from 89 U.S.-based news outlets, we applied a gravity model to analyze relationships between pairs of outlets and produced a novel spatial network visualization. We found that emergent media rely more heavily on legacy media as they become institutionalized. Further, we find that antagonistic linking across ideology is exclusively a conservative phenomenon.

However, the findings also reveal the contingency of this influence in selected contexts as well.","[Popiel, Pawel] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Popiel, P (通讯作者)，3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",ppopiel@asc.upenn.edu,,"Popiel, Pawel/0000-0001-5641-581X",,,,54,1,1,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0883-8151,1550-6878,,J BROADCAST ELECTRON,J.

When analyzing large numbers of images, both traditional content analysis as well as cultural analytics have proven valuable. However, these techniques do not take into account the contextualization of images within a socio-technical environment. As the meaning of social media images is co-created by online publics, bound through networked practices, these visuals should be analyzed on the level of their networked contextualization. Although machine vision is increasingly adept at recognizing faces and features, its performance in grasping the meaning of social media images remains limited. Combining automated analyses of images with platform data opens up the possibility to study images in the context of their resonance within and across online discursive spaces. This article explores the capacities of hashtags and retweet counts to complement the automated assessment of social media images, doing justice to both the visual elements of an imageandthe contextual elements encoded through the hashtag practices of networked publics.","[Geboers, Marloes Annette] Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Van de Wiele, Chad Thomas] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Chicago, IL USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Geboers, MA (通讯作者)，Amsterdam Univ Appl Sci, Fac Digital Media & Creat Ind, Rhijnspoorpl 1, NL-1091 GC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",m.a.geboers@hva.nl,,"Geboers, Marloes/0000-0002-3205-7437",,,,66,3,3,4,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Prior theorizing and research in communication has primarily addressed Marr's computational level (why), but has less frequently investigated algorithmic (what) or implementation (how all communication phenomena emerge from and rely on biological processes) explanations. Here, we introduce Marr's framework and apply it to three research domains in communication science-audience research, persuasion, and social comparisons-to demonstrate what a unifying framework for explaining communication across the levels of why, what, and how can look like, and how Marr's framework speaks to and receives input from all subfields of communication inquiry.","[Huskey, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Cognit Commun Sci Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Bue, Amelia Couture] Univ Michigan, Commun Studies, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Eden, Allison; Grall, Clare; Schmalzle, Ralf; Wilcox, Shelby] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Meshi, Dar] Michigan State Univ, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Prena, Kelsey] Boston Univ, Coll Commun, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Scholz, Christin] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Wv Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Turner, Benjamin O.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Boston University; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Huskey, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Cognit Commun Sci Lab, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",rwhuskey@ucdavis.edu,"Huskey, Richard/H-9286-2019; Turner, Benjamin/AAG-4386-2020; Eden, Allison/E-7246-2011","Huskey, Richard/0000-0002-4559-2439; Turner, Benjamin/0000-0002-4344-9022; Eden, Allison/0000-0003-0846-2739; Meshi, Dar/0000-0003-0772-037X; Couture Bue, Amelia/0000-0003-4488-1025; Schmalzle, Ralf/0000-0002-0179-1364; Wilcox, Shelby/0000-0002-0013-1612",,,,85,6,6,2,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0021-9916,1460-2466,,J COMMUN,J.

In such forums, there is often a large volume of posts with sensitive content, indicating that the user has a risk of suicide and self-harm. Early detection of depression using appropriate deep learning models and social media data can prevent potential self-harm. However, existing depression detection models are not powerful enough to capture critical sentiment information from the large volume of posts published by each user, which makes the performance of these models not satisfying. To address this problem, we propose a hierarchical posts representations model named Multi-Gated LeakyReLU CNN (MGL-CNN) for identifying depressed individuals in online forums. The model consists of two parts: the first one is a post-level operation, which is used to learn the representation of each post of the user, and the second one is a user-level operation, which is used to obtain the overall representation of the user & x2019;s emotional state. Besides, we propose another depression detection model by changing the number of gated units in the MGL-CNN, which is named Single-Gated LeakyReLU CNN (SGL-CNN). We show how to use our models to identify depressed users through a lot of posted content. Experimental results showed that our models performed better than the previous state-of-the-art models on the Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis dataset, and also performed well on the Early Detection of Depression dataset.","[Rao, Guozheng; Zhang, Yue; Cong, Qing; Feng, Zhiyong] Tianjin Univ, Coll Intelligence & Comp, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Rao, Guozheng; Zhang, Yue; Cong, Qing; Feng, Zhiyong] Tianjin Univ, Tianjin Key Lab Cognit Comp & Applicat, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Rao, Guozheng] Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch New Media & Commun, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Li] Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China",Tianjin University; Tianjin University; Tianjin University Science & Technology; Tianjin University Science & Technology,"Zhang, L (通讯作者)，Tianjin Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Tianjin 300072, Peoples R China.",zhangli2006@tust.edu.cn,,"Zhang, Li/0000-0002-3039-6160; Rao, Guozheng/0000-0002-6261-576X; Feng, Zhiyong/0000-0001-8158-7453","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61373165, 61672377]",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 61373165 and Grant 61672377.,,45,7,7,6,13,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,32395,32403,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973737,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,LC6CT,WOS:000525419100049,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

These models have been particularly effective at describing emergent social behavior, such as spatial segregation in neighborhoods or opinion polarization on social networks. ABMs are particularly common in the study of opinion and belief dynamics, being used by fields ranging from anthropology to statistical physics. These models, much like the social systems they describe, often do not have unique output variables, scales, or clear order parameters. This lack of clearly measurable emergent behavior makes such complex ABMs difficult to study, ultimately limiting their application to cases of empirical interest. In this paper, we introduce a series of approaches to analyze complex multidimensional ABMs, drawing from information theory and cluster analysis. We use these approaches to explore a multi-level agent-based model of ideological alignment introduced by Banisch and Olbrisch to extend Mas and Flache's argument communication theory of bi-polarization. We use the tools introduced here to perform a thorough analysis of the model for small system sizes, identifying the convergence toward steady-state behavior, and describing the full spectrum of steady-state distributions produced by this model. Finally, we show how the approach we introduced can be easily adapted for larger implementations, as well as for other complex agent-based models of social behavior.","[Camargo, Chico Q.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Camargo, CQ (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.",chico.camargo@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,52,2,2,1,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-424X,,,FRONT PHYS-LAUSANNE,Front.

We now have large, complex data sets that require more than complex statistical analysis to yield human answers. Yet as some researchers have pointed out, we also have challenges, especially in computational social science. In a recent project I faced several such challenges and eventually realized that the relevant issues were familiar to users of free and open-source software. I needed a team with diverse skills and knowledge to tackle methods, theories, and topics. We needed to iterate over the entire project: from the initial theories to the data to the methods to the results. We had to understand how to work when some data was freely available but other data that might benefit the research was not. More broadly, computational social scientists may need creative solutions to slippery problems, such as restrictions imposed by terms of service for sites from which we wish to gather data. Are these terms legal, are they enforced, or do our institutional review boards care? Lastly-perhaps most importantly and dauntingly-we may need to challenge laws relating to digital data and access, although so far this conflict has been rare.

This approach assumes that nodes interact via forces that derive from the potential that each node creates at the location of the other nodes, leading to a potential gradient that indicates the natural direction of diffusion through the network. A set of influencers in the network, is determined from strategically selected nodes based on the value of their net potential. We use synthetic networks of various sizes and compare the influence spread resulting from a seed set determined from the potential-based model and alternate approaches, including the greedy algorithm of Kempe et al. Our findings indicate that this approach achieves comparable results to those of the greedy algorithm without the prohibitive computational cost, and consistently outperforms the other approaches by a large margin.

This study investigates the hypothesis of speech acoustic characteristics being indicative of trust between team members and team members' familiarity with each other. Speech recordings from 27 dyadic teams (26 males and 28 females) were made during a distributed threat perception task, determining safe points along a route through the town to be visited by a VIP. Before the threat detection mission, 26 team members knew each other, and the remaining 28 had no prior knowledge of their partners. Two levels (Low Trust and High Trust) of two trust constructs, TTP (Trust, Trustworthiness, Propensity to trust), and RIS (Reliance Intentions Scale), were estimated based on numerical responses to pre- and post-mission surveys. Speech recordings of individual speakers were divided into 1-second intervals and converted into RGB images of amplitude spectrograms. The images were classified using a pre-trained convolutional neural network ResNet-18 fine-tuned to recognize either the trust level or familiarity. In the baseline classification scenario, the speech was classified using a single transfer learning into Low/High-trust categories separately for RIS and TTP constructs before and after the mission yielding an average classification accuracy of 82%-86%. Single transfer learning classification into Know/Unknown-partners categories led to 85% accuracy. Application of double transfer learning, i.e., first tuning the ResNet-18 on Know/Unknown labels and then on Low/High-trust, increased the trust classification accuracy up to 89%. When tuning the ResNet-18 on Low/High-trust and then on Known/Unknown labels, the accuracy of partner familiarity recognition was also increased up to 89%. These results support the hypothesis of speech acoustics being indicative of trust and familiarity between team members and show that by adding prior related knowledge to the model, more efficient learning can be achieved without increasing the training data size.","[Rodriguez, Catherine Sandoval; Lech, Margaret] RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Panganiban, April Rose; Stolar, Melissa N.] B CIV USAF AFMC 711 HPW RHXS, Dayton, OH 45433 USA; [Bolia, Robert] Def Sci & Technol Grp, Aerosp Div, Fishermans Bend, Vic 3207, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Defence Science & Technology,"Lech, M (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Sch Engn, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",margaret.lech@rmit.edu.au,,"Sandoval, Catherine/0000-0002-6486-0558",Defence Science Institute Postgraduate Scholarship; Commonwealth of AustraliaAustralian Government [MyIP7098],"This work was supported in part by the Defence Science Institute Postgraduate Scholarship, and in part by the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the Defence Science and Technology (DST) Group under Research Agreement MyIP7098.",,33,0,0,3,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,225437,225447,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3044285,,,11,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PM3SJ,WOS:000603723100001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas most research has focused on documenting and analyzing suicide rates, little is known about more subtle psychological effects of celebrity suicide on the public, such as despair and feelings of abandonment. The Internet has revolutionized the responses to news reports, enabling immediate and anonymous responses potentially reflecting these psychological processes. Thus, the current study explored the unique psychological impact of a celebrity suicide on the public by analyzing the big data of readers' comments to suicide news reports, using computational linguistics methods. Readers' comments (N = 14,506) to suicide news reports were retrieved from 4 leading online news sites. The comments were posted in response to 1 of 1 types of reports: a celebrity suicide (Robin Williams), a non-celebrity suicide, and general reports of suicide as a social phenomenon. LIWC software for computerized linguistic analysis was used to calculate the frequency of the various types of words used. Comparison of the responses to the 3 types of suicide reports revealed higher frequency of first-person pronouns and for emotionally charged words on comments to a celebrity suicide, compared with comments to the other types of suicide reports. The findings suggest that celebrity suicide news reports evoke the expression of positive emotions, possibly related to the venerated celebrity, alongside negative, internalized emotions, and feelings of social isolation.

Among other findings, the results show the transversality of this treatment technique, which can be shaped to be applied in any subject area, and the prevalence of topics such as health, science, and the environment, partly due to circumstances related to the climate emergency together with the current environmental challenges. There is a wide variety of sources, but a strong dependence on documentaries from governments or public offices (59.52%) can be observed as well as widespread use of infographics as a form of visualization (45.24%), generally presented as scrollytelling. It is also deduced that quality is conditioned by the nature of the sources, the innovative character of the analysis carried out, the way in which the information is compiled, and the complexity of the visualizations involved.

Measuring the (Trans-)National Quality of Political Issue Publics on Twitter,MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION,,,,,,,,,,,SOCIAL MEDIA; PATTERNS; NETWORKS; SHAPE,"This article presents a multi-method research design for measuring the (trans-)national quality of issue publics on Twitter. Online communication is widely perceived as having the potential to overcome nationally bound public spheres. Social media, in particular, are seen as platforms and drivers of transnational communication through which users can easily connect across borders. Transnational interactivity can be expected in particular for policy fields of global concern and elite or activist communication as practiced on Twitter. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of evidence for the enduring national structuration of political communication and publics as it results from a shared language (mostly), culturally defined media markets, established routines of social and political communication, and sociocultural stocks of knowledge. The study goes beyond measuring user interaction and also includes indicators of cross-referential cohesion. It applies a set of computational methods in network and discourse analysis and presents empirical evidence for Twitter communication on climate change being a prime issue of global concern and a globalized policy agenda. For empirical analysis, the study relies on a large Twitter dataset (N approximate to 6m tweets) with tweet messages and metadata collected between 2015 and 2018. Based on basic measurements such as geolocation and language use, the metrics allowed measurement of cross-national user interactions, user centrality in communicative networks, linking behaviour, and hashtag co-occurrences. The findings of the exploratory study suggest that a combined perspective on indicators of user interaction and cross-referential cohesion helps to develop a better and more nuanced understanding of online issue publics.","[Schuenemann, Wolf J.] Hildesheim Univ, Inst Social Sci, Polit Sci Dept, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany",University of Hildesheim,"Schunemann, WJ (通讯作者)，Hildesheim Univ, Inst Social Sci, Polit Sci Dept, D-31141 Hildesheim, Germany.",wolf.schuenemann@uni-hildesheim.de,,,DFG Excellence InitiativeGerman Research Foundation (DFG),"Important inspirations for the measurements presented in this article have been drawn from the project Cyberspace(s) and netizens (funded by the DFG Excellence Initiative) and from collaboration with Stefan Steiger and Sebastian Stier at Heidelberg University.

We uncover how the term fake news serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016-2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users' discussions about fake news, manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one's ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that fake news is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions.

Sentiment analysis classifies the message according to their polarity whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. Recently researchers focused on lexical and machine-learning based method for sentiment analysis of social media post. Social media is a micro blogger site in which end users can post their comment in slag language that contains symbols, idioms, misspelled words and sarcastic sentences. Social media data also have curse of dimension problem i.e. high dimension nature of data that required specific pre-processing and feature extraction, which leads to improve classification accuracy. This paper present comprehensive overview of sentiment analysis technique based on recent research and subsequently explores machine learning (SVM, Navies Bayes, Linear Regression and Random Forest) and feature extraction techniques (POS, BOW and HASS tagging) in context of Sentiment analysis over social media data set. Further twitter data-sets are scrutinized and pre-processed with proposed framework,which yield intersecting facts about the capabilities and deficiency of sentiment analysis methods. POS is most suitable feature extraction technique with SVM and Navie Bayes classifier. Whereas Random Forest and linear regression provide the better result with Hass tagging.","[Singh, Nikhil Kumar; Tomar, Deepak Singh] Maulana Azad Natl Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Bhopal, India; [Sangaiah, Arun Kumar] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India",National Institute of Technology (NIT System); Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology Bhopal; Vellore Institute of Technology,"Sangaiah, AK (通讯作者)，Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",nikhilsinghmanit@gmail.com; deepaktomarmanit@gmail.com; arunkumarsangaiah@gmail.com,"singh, Nikhil/AAX-5380-2020; Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/U-6785-2019","Sangaiah, Arun Kumar/0000-0002-0229-2460; SINGH, NIKHIL KUMAR/0000-0001-9396-7285",,,,72,14,14,20,80,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1868-5137,1868-5145,,J AMB INTEL HUM COMP,J.

Based on 21 interviews with digital news editors at 11 Belgian news organisations, including 7 national newspapers, one news magazine, one public and one commercial broadcaster, and one digital-born news medium, the study shows how audience analytics have become normalised in these digital newsrooms and how, in the perception of those who use them, tools for capturing audience behaviour data inform and shape their daily work practices and organisational strategies. Combining insights from literature with empirical findings, the study distinguishes six uses of audience analytics: Not only do analytics inform editorial decisions on (1) story placement, (2) story packaging, (3) story planning and (4) story imitation, but they can also serve as instruments for (5) performance evaluation and (6) audience conception. Overall, the digital news editors are convinced that audience analytics support rather than harm their journalism.","[Lamot, Kenza; Paulussen, Steve] Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Lamot, K (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Fac Social Sci, Antwerp, Belgium.",kenza.lamot@uantwerpen.be,"Lamot, Kenza/AAR-4410-2020; Paulussen, Steve/O-7124-2016","Paulussen, Steve/0000-0002-7903-1103",Research Fund of the University of Antwerp,This work was supported by a grant from the Research Fund of the University of Antwerp.,,33,7,7,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

But during the 2016 US presidential election, social media platforms emerged as a breeding ground for influence campaigns, conspiracy, and alternative media. Anecdotally, the nature of political news and information evolved over time, but political communication researchers have yet to develop a comprehensive, grounded, internally consistent typology of the types of sources shared. Rather than chasing a definition of what is popularly known as fake news, we produce a grounded typology of what users actually shared and apply rigorous coding and content analysis to define the phenomenon. To understand what social media users are sharing, we analyzed large volumes of political conversations that took place on Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign and the 2018 State of the Union address in the United States. We developed the concept of junk news, which refers to sources that deliberately publish misleading, deceptive, or incorrect information packaged as real news. First, we found a 1:1 ratio of junk news to professionally produced news and information shared by users during the US election in 2016, a ratio that had improved by the State of the Union address in 2018. Second, we discovered that amplifier accounts drove a consistently higher proportion of political communication during the presidential election but accounted for only marginal quantities of traffic during the State of the Union address. Finally, we found that some of the most important units of analysis for general political theory-parties, the state, and policy experts-generated only a fraction of the political communication.","[Bradshaw, Samantha] Ctr Int Governance Innovat, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Howard, Philip N.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Internet Studies, Oxford, England; [Howard, Philip N.] Univ Oxford, Balliol Coll, Oxford, England; [Kollanyi, Bence] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Sociol, Budapest, Hungary; [Neudert, Lisa-Maria] Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; Corvinus University Budapest; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Neudert, LM (通讯作者)，Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3LW, England.",lisa-maria.neudert@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research Council through the grant: Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe [648311]; Ford Foundation [0170-0774]; Hewlett Foundation [2018-7384],"This research was funded by the European Research Council through the grant: Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe, Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

The cyber-social network considered here comprises individuals and information sources. Each individual holds an opinion represented by a scalar that evolves over time. The information sources are stubborn, in the sense that their opinions are time-invariant. Individuals receive the opinions of information sources that are closer to their belief, confirmation bias is explicitly incorporated into the model. The proposed dynamics of cyber-social networks is adopted from DeGroot-Friedkin model, where an individual's opinion update mechanism is a convex combination of her innate opinion, her neighbors' opinions at the previous time step (obtained from the social network), and the opinions passed along by information sources from cyber layer which she follows. The characteristics of the interdependent social and cyber networks are significantly different here: the social network relies on trust and hence static, while influences from information sources to individuals are highly dynamic since they are weighted as a function of the distance between an individual state and the state of information source to account for confirmation bias. The conditions for convergence of the aforementioned dynamics to a unique equilibrium point are characterized. The estimation and exact computation of the steady-state values under non-linear and linear state-dependent weight functions are provided. Finally, the impact of polarization in the opinions of information sources on the public opinion evolution is numerically analyzed in the context of the well-known Krackhardt's advice network.","[Mao, Yanbing; Akyol, Emrah] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Bolouki, Sadegh] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 1411713116, Iran",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Tarbiat Modares University,"Mao, YB (通讯作者)，SUNY Binghamton, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",ymao3@binghamton.edu; bolouki@modares.ac.ir; eakyol@binghamton.edu,,"Akyol, Emrah/0000-0002-0663-1677","Binghamton University-SUNY, Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems ORC grant","The authors would like to thank Binghamton University-SUNY, Center for Collective Dynamics of Complex Systems ORC grant.",,32,7,7,7,18,IEEE COMPUTER SOC,LOS ALAMITOS,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",2327-4697,,,IEEE T NETW SCI ENG,IEEE Trans.

They can perform very well for translating clean in-domain texts. However, as demonstrated by previous work, the translation quality significantly worsens when translating noisy texts, such as user-generated texts (UGT) from online social media. Given the lack of parallel data of UGT that can be used to train or adapt NMT systems, we synthesize parallel data of UGT, exploiting monolingual data of UGT through crosslingual language model pre-training and zero-shot NMT systems. This paper presents two different but complementary approaches: One alters given clean parallel data into UGT-like parallel data whereas the other generates translations from monolingual data of UGT. On the MTNT translation tasks, we show that our synthesized parallel data can lead to better NMT systems for UGT while making them more robust in translating texts from various domains and styles.","[Marie, Benjamin; Fujita, Atsushi] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, 3-5 Hikaridai, Kyoto 6190289, Japan",National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan,"Marie, B (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, 3-5 Hikaridai, Kyoto 6190289, Japan.",bmarie@nict.go.jp; atsushi.fujita@nict.go.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [20K19879, 19H05660]; NICT","We would like to thank the action editor, Philipp Koehn, and reviewers for their useful comments and suggestions.

This trend has led to a sudden spurt of information overflow on the Web. The huge volume of such information has to be technically processed for segregating the relevant knowledge. Sentiment analysis is the popular method extensively used for this purpose. It is defined as the computational study of mining the opinions from the available content about the entity of interest. Existing Sentiment analysis techniques quite efficiently capture opinions from text written in syntactically correct and explicit language. However, while dealing with the informal data, limitation has been observed in performance of sentiment analysis techniques. With a view to deal with the imperfect and indirect language used by the netizens, it has become necessary to work on improvement in the existing sentiment analysis techniques. In this regard, the conventional sentiment analysis techniques have shown some improvement on applying the appropriate context information. However, still there is ample scope for further research to find the relevant context and applying it to a given scenario. This systematic literature review paper intends to explore and analyze the existing work on the context-based sentiment analysis and to report gaps and future directions in the said research area.","[Kumar, Akshi; Garg, Geetanjali] Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, New Delhi, India",Delhi Technological University,"Garg, G (通讯作者)，Delhi Technol Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, New Delhi, India.",akshikumar@dce.ac.in; geetudtu@gmail.com,,"Kumar, Akshi/0000-0003-4263-7168",,,,60,10,10,7,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1380-7501,1573-7721,,MULTIMED TOOLS APPL,Multimed.

To identify discriminatory practices in the workplace, job advertisement analysis was used by previous studies. However, most of those studies adopted content analysis by manually coding the text from a limited number of samples since working with a large scale of job advertisements consisting of unstructured text data is very challenging. Encountering those limitations, the present study involves text mining techniques to identify multiple types of direct discrimination on a large scale of online job advertisements by designing a method called Direct Discrimination Detection (DDD). The DDD is constructed using a combination of N-grams and regular expressions (regex) with the exact match principle of a Boolean retrieval model. A total of 8,969 online job advertisements in English and Bahasa Indonesia, published from May 2005 to December 2017 were collected from as the data. The results reveal that the practices of direct discrimination still exist during the job-hunting process including gender, marital status, physical appearances, and religion. The most recurrent type of discrimination which occurs in job advertisements is based on age (66.27%), followed by gender (38.76%), and physical appearances (18.42%). Additionally, female job seekers are found as the most vulnerable party to experience direct discrimination during recruitment. The results exhibit female job seekers face complex jeopardy in particular job positions comparing to their male counterparts. Not only excluded because of their gender, but female job seekers also had to fulfil more requirements for getting an opportunity to apply for the jobs such as being single, still at a young age, complying specific physical appearances and particular religious preferences. This study illustrates the power and potential of optimizing computational methods on a large scale of unstructured text data to analyze phenomena in the social field.","[Ningrum, Panggih Kusuma; Pansombut, Tatdow; Ueranantasun, Attachai] Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Pattani, Thailand",Prince of Songkla University,"Pansombut, T (通讯作者)，Prince Songkla Univ, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Fac Sci & Technol, Pattani, Thailand.",tatdow.pa@psu.ac.th,"Pansombut, Tatdow/AAR-7412-2020; Ueranantasun, Attachai/L-5764-2019","Ningrum, Panggih Kusuma/0000-0002-8630-6603; Pansombut, Tatdow/0000-0003-0536-0833","Thailand's Education Hub for Southern Region of ASEAN Countries (TEH-AC) Scholarship through Prince of Songkla University, Thailand","The authors gratefully acknowledge Thailand's Education Hub for Southern Region of ASEAN Countries (TEH-AC) Scholarship through Prince of Songkla University, Thailand for a scholarship award to support this study.",,68,5,5,1,13,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,44716,2020,15,6,,,,,,,e0233746,10.1371/journal.pone.0233746,,,29,Multidisciplinary Sciences,,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MA6PX,WOS:000542035200004,32497044,"Green Published, gold",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Phishing detection approaches that obtain highly representational features from the text of these e-mails are a suitable strategy to counter these threats since these features can be used to train machine learning algorithms, thus generating models able to classify mail samples as phishing or legitimate messages. This paper proposes a multi-stage approach to detect phishing e-mail attacks using natural language processing and machine learning. The proposed multi-stage approach consists of feature engineering within natural language processing, lemmatization, feature selection, feature extraction, improved learning techniques for resampling and cross-validation, and the configuration of hyperparameters. We present two methods of the proposed approach, the first one exploiting the Chi-Square statistics and the Mutual Information to improve the dimensionality reduction, while the second method associates Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). Both methods handle the problems of the curse of dimensionality, the sparsity, and the amount of information that must be obtained from the context in the Vector Space Model (VSM) representation. These methods yield reduced feature sets that, combined with the XGBoost and Random Forest machine learning algorithms, lead to an F1-measure of 100% success rate, for validation tests with the SpamAssassin Public Corpus and the Nazario Phishing Corpus datasets. Even considering just the text in e-mail bodies, the proposed multi-stage phishing detection approach outperforms state-of-the-art schemes for an accredited data set, requiring a much smaller number of features and presenting lower computational cost.","[Gualberto, Eder Souza; De Sousa, Rafael Timoteo, Jr.; Duque, Claudio Gottschalg] Univ Brasilia, Dept Elect Engn, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Gualberto, Eder Souza; De Brito Vieira, Thiago Pereira] Natl Agcy Telecommun, Superintendence Informat Management, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Da Costa, Joao Paulo Carvalho Lustosa] Hamm Lippstadt Univ Appl Sci, Dept Lippstadt 2, D-59063 Hamm, Germany; [Duque, Claudio Gottschalg] Univ Brasilia, Fac Informat Sci, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia; Universidade de Brasilia,"Gualberto, ES (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Dept Elect Engn, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.; Gualberto, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Agcy Telecommun, Superintendence Informat Management, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",eder.gualberto@redes.unb.br,"Gualberto, Éder Souza/AAL-5879-2021; de Sousa Júnior, Rafael Timóteo/V-3293-2019; Javidi da Costa, João Paulo/C-7382-2013; Duque, Claudio Gottschalg/AAG-5409-2021","Gualberto, Éder Souza/0000-0002-2917-3605; de Sousa Júnior, Rafael Timóteo/0000-0003-1101-3029; Javidi da Costa, João Paulo/0000-0002-8616-4924; vieira, thiago pereira de brito/0000-0003-0512-374X","CAPES-Brazilian Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination [23038.007604/2014-69 FORTE, 88887.144009/2017-00 PROBRAL]; CNPq-Brazilian National Research CouncilConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [312180/2019-5 PQ-2, 303343/2017-6 PQ-2, BRICS 2017-591 LargEWiN, 465741/2014-2 INCT]; FAP-DF Brazilian Federal District Research Support FoundationFundacao de Apoio a Pesquisa do Distrito Federal (FAPDF) [0193.001366/2016 UIoT, 0193.001365/2016 SSDDC]; Brazilian Ministry of the Economy [005/2016 DIPLA, 083/2016 ENAP]; Institutional Security Office of the Presidency of Brazil [ABIN 002/2017]; Administrative Council for Economic Defense [CADE 08700.000047/2019-14]; General Attorney of the Union [AGU 697.935/2019]","This work was supported in part by the CAPES-Brazilian Higher Education Personnel Improvement Coordination under Grant PROAP/UnB/PPGEE, Grant 23038.007604/2014-69 FORTE, and Grant 88887.144009/2017-00 PROBRAL; in part by the CNPq-Brazilian National Research Council under Grant 312180/2019-5 PQ-2, Grant 303343/2017-6 PQ-2, Grant BRICS 2017-591 LargEWiN, and Grant 465741/2014-2 INCT in cybersecurity; in part by the FAP-DF Brazilian Federal District Research Support Foundation under Grant 0193.001366/2016 UIoT and Grant 0193.001365/2016 SSDDC, in part by the Brazilian Ministry of the Economy under Grant 005/2016 DIPLA and Grant 083/2016 ENAP, in part by the Institutional Security Office of the Presidency of Brazil under Grant ABIN 002/2017, in part by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense under Grant CADE 08700.000047/2019-14, and in part by the General Attorney of the Union under Grant AGU 697.935/2019.",,77,1,1,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,223529,223547,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043396,,,19,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,PM3TZ,WOS:000603727300001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, affective expression, in this case posting a status update on Facebook, immediately pushes arousal and valence towards the baseline by a proportional value. These results are robust to the choice of the text analysis technique and illustrate the fast timescale of affective dynamics through social media text. These outcomes are of high relevance for affective computing, the detection and modeling of collective emotions, the refinement of psychological research methodology, and the detection of abnormal, and potentially pathological, individual affect dynamics.","[Pellert, Max; Schweighofer, Simon; Garcia, David] Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Pellert, Max; Schweighofer, Simon; Garcia, David] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Med Stat Informat & Intelligent Syst, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Vienna, Austria",Medical University of Vienna,"Garcia, D (通讯作者)，Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Garcia, D (通讯作者)，Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Med Stat Informat & Intelligent Syst, Sect Sci Complex Syst, Vienna, Austria.",garcia@csh.ac.at,"Pellert, Max/AAK-4900-2020; Garcia, David/A-2113-2014","Pellert, Max/0000-0002-6557-7607; Garcia, David/0000-0002-2820-9151",Vienna Science and Technology Fund through the project Emotional Well-Being in the Digital Society [VRG16-005],This work was funded by the Vienna Science and Technology Fund through the project Emotional Well-Being in the Digital Society (Grant No. VRG16-005).

The study uncovers the dynamic utilization of time and its impact on the democratic meaning of the 2016 election (or the lack thereof) before, during, and after the election in old and new media.

Considering the evaluation methodology of the voice, two main categories of auditory-perceptual assessment and acoustic analysis can be identified. This article presents a new approach for acoustic analysis of voice quality, which brings several advantages to the field. The proposed approach is non-parametric in the sense that it does not require the estimation of the fundamental frequency or spectral response of the vocal tract. This reduces the computational complexity of the measurement and reduces the possible errors due to inaccurate estimation of those parameters. Additionally, the method does not make any assumption about the phonetic context and hence has the potential to be applied to connected speech. The proposed method benefits from the multiresolution structure of the wavelet analysis for estimating the noisy component of a voice in the spectro-temporal domain. The informativeness of the estimated noise for voice quality distinction is examined based on different noise-quantification approaches. It is shown that deviation from the model of the human auditory system (HAS) leads to performance improvement. Through several analyses, it is argued that using models of HAS for quantification of the noise leads to significant loss of information relevant to voice quality. Findings from this article suggest that perception-based measures of voice quality are highly restricted in capturing important aspects of acoustic that could assist with voice quality distinctions. This characteristic is inherent to HAS and cannot be alleviated, highlighting a significant limitation of perception-based measures.","[Ghasemzadeh, Hamzeh] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Ghasemzadeh, Hamzeh] Michigan State Univ, Dept Computat Math Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Arjmandi, Meisam K.] Mass Eye & Ear, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Arjmandi, Meisam K.] Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02114 USA",Michigan State University; Michigan State University; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School,"Ghasemzadeh, H (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.; Ghasemzadeh, H (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Computat Math Sci & Engn, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",ghasemza@msu.edu; meisam_khalilarjmandi@meei.harvard.edu,"ghasemzadeh, hamzeh/P-1424-2018","ghasemzadeh, hamzeh/0000-0001-5395-1908; Khalil Arjmandi, Meisam/0000-0002-4368-9106",,,,50,0,0,0,1,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-9290,2329-9304,,IEEE-ACM T AUDIO SPE,IEEE-ACM Trans.

Online mental health forums can provide a supportive environment for those afflicted and also generate a large amount of data that can be mined to predict mental health states using machine learning methods. Objective: This study aimed to benchmark multiple methods of text feature representation for social media posts and compare their downstream use with automated machine learning (AutoML) tools. We tested on datasets that contain posts labeled for perceived suicide risk or moderator attention in the context of self-harm. Specifically, we assessed the ability of the methods to prioritize posts that a moderator would identify for immediate response. Methods: We used 1588 labeled posts from the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2017 shared task collected from the Reachout.com forum. Posts were represented using lexicon-based tools, including Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner, Empath, and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and also using pretrained artificial neural network models, including DeepMoji, Universal Sentence Encoder, and Generative Pretrained Transformer-1 (GPT-1). We used Tree-based Optimization Tool and Auto-Sklearn as AutoML tools to generate classifiers to triage the posts. Results: The top-performing system used features derived from the GPT-1 model, which was fine-tuned on over 150,000 unlabeled posts from Reachout.com . Our top system had a macroaveraged F1 score of 0.572, providing a new state-of-the-art result on the CLPsych 2017 task. This was achieved without additional information from metadata or preceding posts. Error analyses revealed that this top system often misses expressions of hopelessness. In addition, we have presented visualizations that aid in the understanding of the learned classifiers. Conclusions: In this study, we found that transfer learning is an effective strategy for predicting risk with relatively little labeled data and noted that fine-tuning of pretrained language models provides further gains when large amounts of unlabeled text are available.","[Howard, Derek; Maslej, Marta M.; Ritchie, Jacob; French, Leon] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Campbell Family Mental Hlth Res Inst, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Howard, Derek; Maslej, Marta M.; French, Leon] Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Krembil Ctr Neuroinformat, 250 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada; [Lee, Justin] Univ Toronto, Dept Biochem, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Ritchie, Jacob] Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Woollard, Geoffrey] Univ Toronto, Dept Med Biophys, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Woollard, Geoffrey] Univ Hlth Network, Princess Margaret Canc Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [French, Leon] Univ Toronto, Inst Med Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [French, Leon] Univ Toronto, Dept Psychiat, Div Brain & Therapeut, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction & Mental Health - Canada; University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction & Mental Health - Canada; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University Health Network Toronto; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"French, L (通讯作者)，Ctr Addict & Mental Hlth, Krembil Ctr Neuroinformat, 250 Coll St, Toronto, ON M5T 1R8, Canada.",leon.french@camh.ca,,"Howard, Derek/0000-0002-6621-9473",Canada Foundation for InnovationCanada Foundation for InnovationCGIAR; CAMH Research Hospital Fund; CAMH Foundation; National Science and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC),"The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) Specialized Computing Cluster, which is funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the CAMH Research Hospital Fund, was used to perform this research.

Results suggest that the photos that can be categorized into text and people took the largest share in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Instagram photos. And it was found that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's major way of delivering messages on Instagram was to imprint key messages that call for actions for better health on photos and to provide the source of complementary information on text component of each post. It was also found that photos with more and bigger human faces had lower level of engagement than the others, and happiness and neutral emotions expressed on the faces in photos were negatively associated with engagement.

J,"Mossie, Z; Wang, JH",,,,"Mossie, Zewdie; Wang, Jenq-Haur",,,Vulnerable community identification using hate speech detection on social media,INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,"With the rapid development in mobile computing and Web technologies, online hate speech has been increasingly spread in social network platforms since its easy to post any opinions. Previous studies confirm that exposure to online hate speech has serious offline consequences to historically deprived communities. Thus, research on automated hate speech detection has attracted much attention. However, the role of social networks in identifying hate-related vulnerable community is not well investigated. Hate speech can affect all population groups, but some are more vulnerable to its impact than others. For example, for ethnic groups whose languages have few computational resources, it is a challenge to automatically collect and process online texts, not to mention automatic hate speech detection on social media. In this paper, we propose a hate speech detection approach to identify hatred against vulnerable minority groups on social media. Firstly, in Spark distributed processing framework, posts are automatically collected and pre-processed, and features are extracted using word n-grams and word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec. Secondly, deep learning algorithms for classification such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a variety of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are used for hate speech detection. Finally, hate words are clustered with methods such as Word2Vec to predict the potential target ethnic group for hatred. In our experiments, we use Amharic language in Ethiopia as an example. Since there was no publicly available dataset for Amharic texts, we crawled Facebook pages to prepare the corpus. Since data annotation could be biased by culture, we recruit annotators from different cultural backgrounds and achieved better inter-annotator agreement. In our experimental results, feature extraction using word embedding techniques such as Word2Vec performs better in both classical and deep learning-based classification algorithms for hate speech detection, among which GRU achieves the best result. Our proposed approach can successfully identify the Tigre ethnic group as the highly vulnerable community in terms of hatred compared with Amhara and Oromo. As a result, hatred vulnerable group identification is vital to protect them by applying automatic hate speech detection model to remove contents that aggravate psychological harm and physical conflicts. This can also encourage the way towards the development of policies, strategies, and tools to empower and protect vulnerable communities.","[Mossie, Zewdie] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Int Grad Program Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Wang, Jenq-Haur] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taipei University of Technology; National Taipei University of Technology,"Wang, JH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan.",jhwang@csie.ntut.edu.tw,"Wang, Jenq-Haur/C-4200-2013","Wang, Jenq-Haur/0000-0002-6076-7380","Ministry of Science and Technology, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST107-2218-E-027-002, MOST106-2221-E-027-006]","This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [grant numbers MOST107-2218-E-027-002, MOST106-2221-E-027-006].",,58,22,22,8,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-4573,1873-5371,,INFORM PROCESS MANAG,Inf.

By combining linguistic, computational, and interpretive techniques on data collected from Twitter, this study demonstrates that the alt-right weaponizes white thymos in three ways: visual documentation of white victimization, processes of legitimization of racialized pride, and reinforcement of the rectitude of rage and indignation. The weaponization of white thymos is then shown to be central to the culture of the alt-right and its connectivity with populist radical right politics.","[Ganesh, Bharath] Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Media Studies, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Ganesh, B (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Ctr Media & Journalism Studies, Media Studies, Groningen, Netherlands.",b.ganesh@rug.nl,,,FP7 Security [312827]; H2020 European Research Council [648311],This work was supported by FP7 Security [grant number 312827]; H2020 European Research Council [grant number 648311].,,123,11,11,4,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0950-2386,1466-4348,,CULT STUD,Cult.

Existing approaches in this regard are based mainly on temporal patterns mined with the assumption that enough temporal data is available on hand. However, most Web events do not have a long lifecycle, but a burst property, which drastically reduces the performance of temporal patterns mining. Furthermore, these approaches overlook the influence of the social context surrounding the Web events. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict future trends of Web events, based on their social contexts rather than temporal patterns. More specially, in the proposed method, a computational model for the social context is first built as a two-layer Association Linked Network considering its properties, such as the associative network property and the small world property. Then, the interaction between a Web event and the social context is simulated, based on the anchoring theory. Finally, an external force is defined and evaluated to quantify the influence of the social context on the evolution of Web events, which is used to predict future trends of Web events. Experiments show that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of the traditional time series-based approaches.","[Xuan, Junyu; Luo, Xiangfeng] Shanghai Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Sci, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xuan, Junyu; Lu, Jie; Zhang, Guangquan] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Ctr Artificial Intelligence, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Shanghai University; University of Technology Sydney,"Luo, XF (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, Sch Comp Engn & Sci, 99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",Junyu.Xuan@uts.edu.au; luoxf@shu.edu.cn; Jie.Lu@uts.edu.au; Guangquan.Zhang@uts.edu.au,,"Xuan, Junyu/0000-0002-8367-6908",,,,72,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1386-145X,1573-1413,,WORLD WIDE WEB,World Wide Web,MAY,2020,23,3,,,SI,,1861,1886,,10.1007/s11280-019-00753-2,,,26,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering",,Computer Science,LS0YD,WOS:000536118500017,,Green Submitted,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

However, research on news sharing in this particular media environment is lacking. Based on the virality of sixteen partisan outlets' coverage of immigration and using the latest computational linguistic algorithm, the present study probes how hyper-partisan news sharing is related to source transparency, content styles, and moral framing. The study finds that the most shared articles reveal author names, but not necessarily other types of author information. The study uncovers a salient link between moral frames and virality. In particular, audiences are more sensitive to moral frames that emphasize authority/respect, fairness/reciprocity, and harm/care.","[Xu, Weiai Wayne] Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Commun, N334 Integrat Learning Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Sang, Yoonmo; Kim, Christopher] Univ Canberra, Fac Arts & Design, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; University of Canberra,"Xu, WW (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Amherst, Dept Commun, N334 Integrat Learning Ctr, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",weiaixu@umass.edu,,"Xu, Weiai/0000-0002-7369-3886; Sang, Yoonmo/0000-0003-3439-0417",,,,70,12,12,6,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Insights from Computational Analysis of Online Reviews,MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION,,,,,,,,,,,BOX-OFFICE PERFORMANCE; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; ENTERTAINMENT; MEDIA; GRATIFICATION; CHILDREN; MODEL; USER,"The question of what is important when we evaluate movies is crucial for understanding how lay audiences experience and evaluate entertainment products such as films. In line with this, subjective movie evaluation criteria (SMEC) have been conceptualized as mental representations of important attitudes toward specific film features. Based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of self-report data from online surveys, previous research has found and validated eight dimensions. Given the large-scale evaluative information that is available in online users' comments in movie databases, it seems likely that what online users write about movies may enrich our knowledge about SMEC. As a first fully exploratory attempt, drawing on an open-source dataset including movie reviews from IMDb, we estimated a correlated topic model to explore the underlying topics of those reviews. In 35,136 online movie reviews, the most prevalent topics tapped into three major categories-Hedonism, Actors' Performance, and Narrative-and indicated what reviewers mostly wrote about. Although a qualitative analysis of the reviews revealed that users mention certain SMEC, results of the topic model covered only two SMEC: Story Innovation and Light-heartedness. Implications for SMEC and entertainment research are discussed.","[Schneider, Frank M.; Dietrich, Felix] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany; [Domahidi, Emese] TU Ilmenau, Inst Media & Commun Sci, D-98693 Ilmenau, Germany",University of Mannheim; Technische Universitat Ilmenau,"Schneider, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",frank.schneider@uni-mannheim.de; emese.domahidi@tu-ilmenau.de; fedietri@mail.uni-mannheim.de,"Schneider, Frank M./F-5216-2018","Schneider, Frank M./0000-0003-1028-0854; Dietrich, Felix/0000-0002-0696-3380","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; University of Mannheim, Germany","The publication of this article was funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg and the University of Mannheim, Germany.",,62,1,1,7,9,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2020,8,3,,,,,153,163,,10.17645/mac.v8i3.3134,,,11,Communication,,Communication,NE6KQ,WOS:000562709200002,,"Green Published, gold",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most innovative actors in this process has been the Russian state, whose disinformation campaigns have influenced elections and shaped political discourse globally. A key element of these campaigns is the content produced by state-funded outlets like RT and Sputnik, whose articles are republished by underfunded or sympathetic local media, as well as coordinated groups that attempt to shape mainstream political narratives. Using a tailored text-as-data approach, we examine the thematic and linguistic differences in articles produced by U.S. and Russian state-funded and mainstream outlets in Serbia. We use 11 features (frames and in-text characteristics) to construct an article country-source classifier with a high degree of accuracy. The article contributes toward an understanding of the structural characteristics of Russian state-funded news in the Western Balkans, enhances the application of computational text analysis in Serbian, and provides suggestions for the application of text-as-data methods to the study of online disinformation.","[Denkovski, Ognjan; Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Denkovski, O (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",o.denkovski@uva.nl; d.c.trilling@uva.nl,,,University of Amsterdam Digital Communication Methods Lab,We thank the University of Amsterdam Digital Communication Methods Lab for funding this research.,,69,0,0,0,2,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. Objective: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. Methods: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Results: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the Wuhan pneumonia-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. Conclusions: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized. Understanding the nomenclature and biased terms employed in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak is paramount. We propose solidarity with communication professionals in combating the COVID-19 outbreak and the infodemic. Finding solutions to curb the spread of virus bias, stigma, and discrimination is imperative.","[Chang, Angela] Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, E21-2056,Ave Univ, Taipa 100, Macao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Angela; Schulz, Peter Johannes] Lugano Univ, Inst Commun & Hlth, Lugano, Switzerland; [Tu, ShengTsung] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Radio & Televis, Taipei, Taiwan; [Liu, Matthew Tingchi] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Dept Management & Mkt, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China",University of Macau; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Ming Chuan University; University of Macau,"Chang, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Dept Commun, E21-2056,Ave Univ, Taipa 100, Macao, Peoples R China.",wychang@um.edu.mo,,"Schulz, Peter Johannes/0000-0003-4281-489X; Tu, Shengtsung/0000-0001-7911-6601; Liu, Matthew/0000-0002-1820-5691","University of Macau [MYRG2019-00079-FSS, MYRG2020-00206-FSS]; Macao Higher Education Bureau [HSS-UMAC-2020-09]",This study is funded by the University of Macau (MYRG2019-00079-FSS; MYRG2020-00206-FSS) and Macao Higher Education Bureau (HSS-UMAC-2020-09).

The extrema of individual sentiment (euphoria and depression) are known to be correlated with people's social interaction, including activity in forums and social-media sites. Yet causality direction of this correlation still requires scrutiny and scientific analysis. The difficulty of such analysis comes, first and foremost, from the complexity of sentiment quantification. It is even more difficult to measure a shared sentiment of a community, due to the echo chamber effect. In addition, media analysis presents its own computational challenges, which were insurmountable until recent times, when we have been presented with unprecedented technical possibilities for quantification of community sentiment and its factors at a level of granularity never seen before. Behavioral psychology suggests that people's behavior can be used as a measurable proxy for their sentiment. Behaviorist theory has been enhanced with the proliferation of targeted advertising and marketing science in the corporate world, and a number of phenomena connecting people's sentiment and social behavior have been explained using behavioral psychology. In addition, advances in the theory and practice of data mining and machine learning have enabled non-empirical approaches to quantitative sociological analysis and development of new indicators of communal well-being that rely on the analysis of historical data. These considerations make it possible to investigate the interactions between media sentiment and community. This is the theme of the present submission.","[Gilgur, Alexander; Ramirez-Marquez, Jose Emmanuel] Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA",Stevens Institute of Technology,"Gilgur, A (通讯作者)，Stevens Inst Technol, Sch Syst & Enterprises, Hoboken, NJ 07030 USA.",agilgur@stevens.edu; jmarquez@stevens.edu,,"Gilgur, Alexander/0000-0003-1765-8434",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1541165],"The research performed by Jose E.

The aim of this project is to explore the interaction between science and the public in the digital world as a complement to traditional studies on the societal impact of science, particularly on the social network Twitter It thus proposes a low-cost easily reproducible methodology involving the design of an algorithm operating on representative sets of tweets to analyse their content by using computational techniques of data mining and natural language processing. To test this methodology. I analyse the communications of the popular science communicator Neil DeGrasse Tyson. The impact of the information is calculated in terms of 1) likes and retweets; 2) suggested formulas for measuring the popularity and controversial nature of the content; and 3) the semantic network Relevant elements of the communications are then identified and classified according to the categories of science'', culture, political social beliefs, media and emotional. The results reveal that content with an emotional charge in the communicator's message niggers a substantially more profound response from the public, as do references to socio-political issues. Moreover, numerous concepts peripheral to the scientific discussion arouse more interest than the concepts central to the communication, Both these results suggest that science is more interesting when it is linked to other issues.","[Denia, Elena] Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Innovat & Knowledge Management INGENIO, Sci Commun, Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC-UPV - INGENIO; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Denia, E (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Valencia, CSIC, Inst Innovat & Knowledge Management INGENIO, Sci Commun, Valencia, Spain.",elenadeniacc@gmail.com,"Denia, Elena/AAF-2844-2019","Denia, Elena/0000-0002-9187-9051","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities [CSO2013-48053-R, BES-2014-069584]","Research included in the R&D project Scientific Excellence, Knowledge Transfer, Organizational Factors, Individual Backgrounds, Societal Impact (CSO2013-48053-R), funded with the BES-2014-069584 grant from the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (2015-2019).",,38,3,3,3,15,GRUPO COMUNICAR,HUELVA,"APDO CORREOS 527, HUELVA, 21080, SPAIN",1134-3478,1988-3293,,COMUNICAR,Comunicar,OCT,2020,28,65,,,,,21,30,,10.3916/C65-2020-02,,,10,Communication; Education & Educational Research,,Communication; Education & Educational Research,OL2AN,WOS:000585143200002,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, the popularisation of digital platforms has facilitated the process of political communication while social networks have become one of the preferred communicative tools for political populists to spread their messages. Drawing on the idea that computational technologies allow a particular performance of populism (Baldwin-Philippi, 2019), this paper aims to foster a better theoretical understanding of how innovation in communication technologies contribute to the success of populism. It is argued that the characteristics of populism (a focus on 'the people', technological savviness and chameleonism) allow it to overcome most of the obstacles put in place by digital networks. In particular, populism is in ideal situation to deal with the phenomena of context collapse in social media (Boyd; Marwick, 2011). Finally, it is argued that in the era of personalized politics (Bennett, 2012), populists can make use of real-time data-driven techniques to develop successful communicative strategies addressed to mass audiences in order to construct the populist self in the image and likeness of the people. This form of populism is called data-driven populism.","[Guerrero-Sole, Frederic; Suarez-Gonzalo, Sara; Rovira, Cristofol; Codina, Lluis] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Comun, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain; [Rovira, Cristofol; Codina, Lluis] UPF Barcelona, Sch Management, Balmes 134, Barcelona 08008, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Pompeu Fabra University,"Guerrero-Sole, F (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Comun, Roc Boronat 138, Barcelona 08018, Spain.",frederic.guerrero@upf.edu; sarapaz.suarez@upf.edu; cristofol.rovira@upf.edu; lluis.codina@upf.edu,"Suárez-Gonzalo, Sara/E-6236-2017; Rovira, Cristofol/C-6419-2009; Codina, Lluis/B-6369-2008","Suárez-Gonzalo, Sara/0000-0001-6883-1984; Rovira, Cristofol/0000-0002-6463-3216; Guerrero-Sole, Frederic/0000-0001-8145-8707; Codina, Lluis/0000-0001-7020-1631","ERDFEuropean Commission [RTI2018-095714-B-C21, PGC2018097352-A-I00]; Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (Spain)","This research was funded by the project Polarization, duplication of active audiences and populism on Twitter.

On the basis of our findings, we evaluate data-driven journalism's potential for improvement with regard to journalism's societal functions.","[Loosen, Wiebke] Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Journalism Res, Hamburg, Germany; [Reimer, Julius] Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany; [De Silva-Schmidt, Fenja] Univ Hamburg, Chair Commun Sci Especially Climate & Sci Commun, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Loosen, W (通讯作者)，Hans Bredow Inst Media Res, Rothenbaumchaussee 36, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",w.loosen@hans-bredow-institut.de,,"Reimer, Julius/0000-0002-5961-909X; Loosen, Wiebke/0000-0002-2211-2260",,,,30,29,29,12,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2020,21,9,,,,,1246,1263,,10.1177/1464884917735691,,,18,Communication,,Communication,MZ7DY,WOS:000559289200006,,,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

With this increase, it is becoming necessary for media researchers to explore ways to better understand production, content and reception patterns of online news in the continent. This paper introduces freely available tools for systematic and (semi-)automated collection, storage and analysis of digital news that builds on recent advances in the computational power of personal computers, and the decreasing costs of storing large amounts of data. I start by describing existing challenges in the collection of online news text data, including the limited amount of African news content in commercial databases, and the methodological shortcomings of using commercial search engines. Then, I present a four-stage approach using packages written in the open-source R programming language to automate the collection of online news content (web scraping); transform this content for easier storage and analysis (data processing); use computational text analysis tools to describe and categorise data; and present the results in ways that are easier to understand (data visualisation). The paper concludes with a summary of recommendations for using computational methods to study African communication phenomena.","[Madrid-Morales, Dani] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77004 USA",University of Houston System; University of Houston,"Madrid-Morales, D (通讯作者)，Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77004 USA.",dmmorales2@uh.edu,"Madrid-Morales, Dani/I-7902-2019","Madrid-Morales, Dani/0000-0002-1522-5857",,,,59,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2374-3670,2374-3689,,AFR JOURNAL STUD,Afr.

By using an original model based on three conceptual lenses - materiality, performativity and reflexivity - this study examines the development of this form of journalism, the challenges it faces and its particularities in the context of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This research, therefore, offers unique insights from semi-structured interviews with data journalists and data editors based at, or working as freelancers for, the mainstream news organisations of these regions. The results suggest that data journalism in these devolved nations displays a distinctive character just as much as it reinforces the norms and rituals of the legacy organisations that pioneered this practice. While various models of data exploitation are tested, regional data journalists creatively circumvent generalised organisational struggles to lay the groundwork for their trade and professional community.","[Borges-Rey, Eddy] Univ Stirling, Journalism Studies, Stirling, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Borges-Rey, E (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Div Commun Media & Culture, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",eddy.borges-rey@stir.ac.uk,,"Borges-Rey, Eddy/0000-0003-2833-0901",,,,27,27,29,3,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2020,21,7,,,,,915,932,,10.1177/1464884917693864,,,18,Communication,,Communication,MP8DH,WOS:000552429700003,,Green Accepted,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we attempt to extend current knowledge on this topic by exploring the degree to which individual levels of ideological extremity, social trust, and trust in the news media are associated with the dissemination of countermedia content, or web-based, ideologically extreme information that uses false, biased, misleading, and hyper-partisan claims to counter the knowledge produced by the mainstream news media. To investigate these possible associations, we used a combination of self-report survey data and trace data collected from Facebook and Twitter. The results suggested that sharing countermedia content on Facebook is positively associated with ideological extremity and negatively associated with trust in the mainstream news media.

At the same time, aggregating them into broad topics or issues often is too coarse and loses nuance. Both theoretically and methodologically, the analysis of an appropriate intermediate level of aggregation is underdeveloped. This article advances research in various areas of journalism studies by developing a theoretical argument for introducing the news event as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. We provide two approaches: One based on traditional tf center dot idf based cosine similarities, and one that relies on word embeddings, in particular the softcosine measure. Both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, perform very well in detecting news events. We apply this method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the events they cover.","[Trilling, Damian; van Hoof, Marieke] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam,"Trilling, D (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.c.trilling@uva.nl,,"van Hoof, Marieke/0000-0002-4117-837X; Trilling, Damian/0000-0002-2586-0352",SURF Cooperative,This work was carried out on the Dutch national e-infrastructure with the support of SURF Cooperative.,,59,2,2,4,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

In an exploratory corpus of 1 public speech, 10 influential news media articles on the same news and 37,500 trending tweets, the same pandemic declaration elicited a wide spectrum of perceptions retrieved by automatic language processing. While the WHO adopted a narrative strategy of mitigating the pandemic by raising public concern, some news media promoted fear for economic repercussions, while others channelled trust in contagion containment through semantic associations with science. In Italy, the first country to adopt a nationwide lockdown, social discourse perceived the pandemic with anger and fear, emotions of grief elaboration, but also with trust, a useful mechanism for coping with threats. Whereas news mostly elicited individual emotions, social media promoted much richer perceptions, where negative and positive emotional states coexisted, and where trust mainly originated from politics-related jargon rather than from science. This indicates that social media linked the pandemics to institutions and their intervention policies. Since both trust and fear strongly influence people's risk-averse behaviour and mental/physical wellbeing, identifying evidence for these emotions is key under a global health crisis. Cognitive network science opens the way to unveiling the emotional framings of massively read news in automatic ways, with relevance for better understanding how information was framed and perceived by large audiences.","[Stella, Massimo] Univ Exeter, Dept Comp Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England; [Stella, Massimo] Complex Sci Consulting, Via Amilcare Foscarini 2, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Exeter,"Stella, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Dept Comp Sci, Exeter EX4 4QF, Devon, England.; Stella, M (通讯作者)，Complex Sci Consulting, Via Amilcare Foscarini 2, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",massimo.stella@inbox.com,,"Stella, Massimo/0000-0003-1810-9699",,,,38,1,1,7,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-8954,,SYSTEMS-BASEL,Systems-Basel,DEC,2020,8,4,,,,,,,38,10.3390/systems8040038,,,13,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,PJ6JP,WOS:000601871700001,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel data set consisting of mainstream newspapers, Twitter and forum data, the study answers two questions: What do Swedish media actually talk about when they talk about migration? And how do they talk about it? Using a combination of computational text analysis tools, I analyze a shift in the media discourse seen as one of the outcomes of the European refugee crisis in 2015 and try to understand the role of social media in this process. The results of the study indicate that messages on social media generally had negative tonality and suggest that some of the media frames can be attributed to a migration-hostile discourse. At the same time, the analysis of framing and sentiment dynamics provides little evidence for the discourse shift and any long-term effects of the European refugee crisis on the Swedish media discourse. Rather, one can hypothesize that the role of the crisis should be viewed in a broader political and historical context.","[Yantseva, Victoria] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Social Studies, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Yantseva, Victoria] Linnaeus Univ, Ctr Data Intens Sci & Applicat DISA, Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University; Linnaeus University,"Yantseva, V (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Dept Social Studies, Ctr Data Intens Sci DISA, Univ Platsen 1, S-35252 Vaxjo, Sweden.",victoria.yantseva@lnu.se,,"Yantseva, Victoria/0000-0001-9938-2675","Linnaeus University Center for Data Intensive Sciences and Applications, DISA","The research presented in this article was supported by the Linnaeus University Center for Data Intensive Sciences and Applications, DISA (http://lnu.se/disa).DISA's High-Performance Computing Centre was used to perform the data collection and analysis.

Contrary to many of those claims, this paper uses observational multiplatform data capturing both desktop and mobile use to demonstrate that coexposure to diverse news is on the rise, and that ideological self-selection does not explain most of that coexposure. We show that mainstream media outlets offer the common ground where ideologically diverse audiences converge online, though our analysis also reveals that more than half of the US online population consumes no online news, underlining the risk of increased information inequality driven by self-selection along lines of interest. For this study, we use an unprecedented combination of observed data from the United States comprising a 5-y time window and involving tens of thousands of panelists.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how social media has altered the foci and methods in public health research remains lacking. Objective: This study aims to examine research themes, the role of social media, and research methods in social media-based public health research published from 2000 to 2018. Methods: A dataset of 3419 valid studies was developed by searching a list of relevant keywords in the Web of Science and PubMed databases. In addition, this study employs an unsupervised text-mining technique and topic modeling to extract research themes of the published studies. Moreover, the role of social media and research methods adopted in those studies were analyzed. Results: This study identifies 25 research themes, covering different diseases, various population groups, physical and mental health, and other significant issues. Social media assumes two major roles in public health research: produce substantial research interest for public health research and furnish a research context for public health research. Social media provides substantial research interest for public health research when used for health intervention, human-computer interaction, as a platform of social influence, and for disease surveillance, risk assessment, or prevention. Social media acts as a research context for public health research when it is mere reference, used as a platform to recruit participants, and as a platform for data collection. While both qualitative and quantitative methods are frequently used in this emerging area, cutting edge computational methods play a marginal role. Conclusions: Social media enables scholars to study new phenomena and propose new research questions in public health research. Meanwhile, the methodological potential of social media in public health research needs to be further explored.","[Zhang, Yan; Cao, Bolin; Wang, Yifan; Wang, Xiaohua] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Rm809,Bldg L7,South Campus,Nanhai Ave, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Peng, Tai-Quan] Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Shenzhen University; Michigan State University,"Cao, BL (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Rm809,Bldg L7,South Campus,Nanhai Ave, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",caobolin@szu.edu.cn,"Peng, Tai-Quan/B-3176-2011","Peng, Tai-Quan/0000-0002-2588-7491; Cao, Bolin/0000-0001-8743-1361; Wang, Yifan/0000-0003-0831-2319","National Social Science Fund of China [19ZDA324, 18CXW017]; Junior Faculty Supporting Fund at Shenzhen University [QNFC1903, RC109127]","This study was supported by National Social Science Fund of China (19ZDA324 and 18CXW017), Junior Faculty Supporting Fund at Shenzhen University (QNFC1903), and a research grant awarded to TQP at Michigan State University (RC109127).",,65,2,2,9,27,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

However, their implications in policy application usually remain superficial and fail to fully exploit state-of-the-art resources which digital era holds for text analysis. This paper illustrates the potential of deep-narrative analysis in energy policy research using text analysis tools from the cutting-edge domain of computational social sciences, notably topic modelling. We argue that a nested application of topic modelling and grounded theory in narrative analysis promises advances in areas where manual-coding driven narrative analysis has traditionally struggled with directionality biases, scaling, systematisation and repeatability. The nested application of the topic model and the grounded theory goes beyond the frequentist approach of narrative analysis and introduces insight generation capabilities based on the probability distribution of words and topics in a text corpus. In this manner, our proposed methodology deconstructs the corpus and enables the analyst to answer research questions based on the foundational element of the text data structure.

Hashtags, which manifest thoughts and feelings clearly and concisely, originated on Twitter, where the length of a post is limited; their use, however, has expanded into other social media services, including Instagram. Hashtags, which make it easy to find and express support for posts of interest, have been widely used for online activism, although they have been criticized for fostering confirmation bias. Moreover, hashtag activism in photo form has been relatively understudied. This research analyzed Instagram photos with antivaccination hashtags as an example of hashtag activism through photos. In addition, we examined how the photo features were related to public response, which was manifested via engagement and comment sentiment. The results suggest that the photos which were categorized into text took the largest share. It was also found that the major way of claiming was to imprint key messages that persuade people not to vaccinate with remarks from professionals on photos and provide a source of supporting information in the post text with hashtags of antivaccine intention. Various photo features showed associations with engagement and comment sentiment, but the directions of correlation were usually the opposite: these results suggest that engagement and comment sentiment are separate domains that reveal different public responses.","[Kim, Yunhwan] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Media Commun, Seoul 02450, South Korea; [Song, Donghwi] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Sch Business, Seoul 02450, South Korea; [Lee, Yeon Ju] Korea Univ, Div Appl Math Sci, Seoul 30019, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Hankuk University Foreign Studies; Korea University,"Lee, YJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Div Appl Math Sci, Seoul 30019, South Korea.",yunhwankim2@hufs.ac.kr; 201501686@hufs.ac.kr; leeyeonju08@korea.ac.kr,"Kim, Yunhwan/AAP-5825-2021","Kim, Yunhwan/0000-0003-1138-6802","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2017R1E1A1A03071025]","This work was supported by NRF-2017R1E1A1A03071025 through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.",,86,3,2,7,12,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

While prior news diversity studies have contributed important theoretical insights, we argue here that scholarly knowledge of this concept can be significantly advanced by employing computational methods for text analysis. Using automated methods, researchers can increase both the scope of data being analyzed and the resolution of the analysis. This article presents a novel framework for analyzing news diversity consisting of two distinct stages. In the first stage, a computational text classification method is used to analyze, at a high resolution, the attention given in news texts to a broad range of political and social issues. In the second stage, the text classifications are aggregated, and the distributions of media attention to those issues (i.e., news diversity) are assessed on a large scale. After presenting the novel approach, we illustrate its usefulness for testing theoretical hypotheses about news diversity. We compare the diversity of economic coverage in three elite and three popular US newspapers (N= 252,807 articles) and find that a fine-grained analysis relaxes concerns raised in previous studies about low content diversity in the popular press.","[Amsalem, Eran] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel; [Fogel-Dror, Yair; Shenhav, Shaul R.] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, Jeruslaem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci & Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Amsalem, E (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel.",eran.amsalem@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Shenhav, Shaul/0000-0002-8820-3579; Sheafer, Tamir/0000-0002-9242-2264; Amsalem, Eran/0000-0002-3135-9775",,,,59,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

How does the platform's emotional architecture intervene in these sense-making, interactive processes? What kinds of mediated publics emerge on and through Facebook as a result? We study these questions through topic modeling 40,500 junk news articles, quantitatively analyzing their engagement metrics, and a qualitative comment analysis. This exploratory research design allows us to move between levels of public discourse, zooming in from cross-outlet talking points to microsociological processes of meaning-making, interaction, and emotional entrainment taking place within the comment boxes themselves. We propose the concepts of delighting and detesting engagement to illustrate how the interplay between audiences, platform architecture, and political junk news generates a bivalent emotional dynamic that routinely divides posts into highly loved and highly angering. We argue that high-performing (or in everyday parlance, viral) junk news bring otherwise disparate audience members together and orient their dramatic focus toward objects of collective joy, anger, or concern. In this context, the nature of political junk news is performative as they become resources for emotional signaling and the construction of group identity and shared feeling on social media. The emotions that animate junk news audiences typically refer back to a transpiring social relationship between two political sides. This affectively loaded us versus them dynamic is both enforced by Facebook's emotional architecture and made use of by junk news publishers.","[Savolainen, Laura] Univ Helsinki, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Sociol, Helsinki, Finland; [Trilling, Damian] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Liotsiou, Dimitra] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Savolainen, L (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, POB 24, Helsinki 00014, Finland.",laura.savolainen@helsinki.fi,,"Savolainen, Laura/0000-0002-5979-1607","European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [648311, 767454]; Open Society Foundation; Ford Foundation","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Junk News Aggregator project was funded by the European Research Council through the grant Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe, Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

Two agents communicate using a finite linguistic vocabulary in order to convey a concept. This is tested in the color domain, and a natural reinforcement learning mechanism is shown to converge to a scheme that achieves a near-optimal trade-off of simplicity versus communication efficiency. Results are presented both on the communication efficiency as well as on analyses of the resulting partitions of the color space. The effect of varying environmental factors such as noise is also studied. These results suggest that RL offers a powerful and flexible computational framework that can contribute to the development of communication schemes for color names that are near-optimal in an information-theoretic sense and may shape color-naming systems across languages. Our approach is not specific to color and can be used to explore cross-language variation in other semantic domains.","[Kageback, Mikael; Carlsson, Emil; Dubhashi, Devdatt] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sayeed, Asad] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Philosophy Linguist & Theory Sci, Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Gothenburg,"Kageback, M (通讯作者)，Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Gothenburg, Sweden.",mikael@kageback.se,,"Kageback, Mikael/0000-0001-8558-1673",project Towards a knowledgebased culturomics - Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research Council [2012-5738]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2014-39]; CHAIR (Chalmers AI Research Center),"Mikael Kageback and Devdatt Dubhashi were funded by the project Towards a knowledgebased culturomics supported by a framework grant from the Swedish Research Council (2012-2016; dnr 2012-5738), and Asad Sayeed is funded by the Swedish Research Council grant 2014-39 that funds the Centre for Linguistic Theory and Studies in Probability at the Department of Philosophy, Linguistics, and Theory of Science at the University of Gothenburg.

We study American, British, and German sources on the 2016 United States presidential election, the 2017 United Kingdom general election, and the 2017 German federal election. There, groups of speakers maneuvered between enthusiastic, skeptical, agnostic, or admonitory stances and so cannot be clearly mapped onto these four discursive positions. Coming along with the inconsistent accounts, public sensemaking was marked by an atmosphere of speculation about the substance and effects of computational politics.

The search engine displays a suicide-prevention result (SPR) at the very top of some suicide-related search results. This SPR comes as an info box and contains supposedly helpful crisis help information such as references to a telephone counseling service. Objective: It remains unknown, however, how Google has implemented the SPR in the especially dangerous context of celebrity suicide for which imitational copycat suicides in vulnerable individuals are most likely. Method: Relying on agent-based testing, a computational social science method, we emulated a total of 137,937 Google searches in April 2019, using both general suicide-related and specific celebrity suicide-related search terms. Given the recently discovered language-based differences in SPR display rates, we held the language constant and focused on German-speaking populations in four European countries. Results: The SPR was never shown in searches for celebrities who died by suicide in all four countries. Furthermore, analyses indicated a digital divide in access to suicide-prevention information with moderately high SPR display rates in Germany and Switzerland, yet with no display in Austria and Belgium. Conclusion: Higher SPR display rates could support global suicide-prevention efforts at virtually no cost by providing preventive information to vulnerable users precisely at the moment when it is apparently needed.","[Arendt, Florian] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Haim, Mario] Univ Stavanger, Dept Media & Social Sci, Stavanger, Norway; [Scherr, Sebastian] Univ Leuven KU, Sch Mass Commun Res, Leuven, Belgium",University of Vienna; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Arendt, F (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Wahringer Str 29, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",florian.arendt@univie.ac.at,"Scherr, Sebastian/ABE-5525-2020","Scherr, Sebastian/0000-0003-4730-1575",,,,27,3,3,0,1,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0277-9536,,,SOC SCI MED,Soc.

Beyond, we test whether such resonance is higher within the conservative media. We rely on news value theory to shed light on the mechanism facilitating or hindering such resonance and identify three indicators for resonance: frames, positions and actors. Using various computational methods as well as qualitative case studies, we examine the skeptical and traditional media discourses over a period of two years. Our analysis shows that there is no continuous resonance. However, our data reveal selective resonance: skeptics' manage to exploit specific events pushing their frames and positions onto traditional media's agenda. Thereby, conservative media did not give greater resonance to climate skeptical voices whereas they resort to downplaying the issue by allocating less space to it.","[Adam, Silke; Reber, Ueli; Haeussler, Thomas] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland; [Schmid-Petri, Hannah] Univ Passau, Ctr Media & Commun, Passau, Germany",University of Bern; University of Passau,"Reber, U (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Bern, Switzerland.",ueli.reber@ikmb.unibe.ch,,"Reber, Ueli/0000-0001-8036-4493","German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [FOR 1381, 155794648]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [100017E-154100]","This publication was created in the context of the Research Unit Political Communication in the Online World(FOR 1381), Subproject 07 (applicant S.A.), which is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG, https://www.dfg.de, project number 155794648).

Several context-specific reasons influence drug use and recovery. In particular emotional distress, physical pain, relationships, and self-development efforts are known to be some of the factors associated with addiction recovery. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not directly observable and quantifying, and assessing their impact can be difficult. Based on social media posts of users engaged in substance use and recovery on the forum Reddit, we employed two psycholinguistic tools, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Empath and activities of substance users on various Reddit sub-forums to analyze behavior underlining addiction recovery and relapse. We then employed a statistical analysis technique called structural equation modeling to assess the effects of these latent factors on recovery and relapse. Results We found that both emotional distress and physical pain significantly influence addiction recovery behavior. Self-development activities and social relationships of the substance users were also found to enable recovery. Furthermore, within the context of self-development activities, those that were related to influencing the mental and physical well-being of substance users were found to be positively associated with addiction recovery. We also determined that lack of social activities and physical exercise can enable a relapse. Moreover, geography, especially life in rural areas, appears to have a greater correlation with addiction relapse. Conclusions The paper describes how observable variables can be extracted from social media and then be used to model important latent constructs that impact addiction recovery and relapse. We also report factors that impact self-induced addiction recovery and relapse. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first use of structural equation modeling of social media data with the goal of analyzing factors influencing addiction recovery.","[Jha, Deeptanshu; Singh, Rahul] San Francisco State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Singh, R (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",rahul@sfsu.edu,,,National Institutes for HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [1R25MD011714]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-1817239]; Center for Computing in Life Sciences at San Francisco State University,"This research and its publication was funded in part by the National Institutes for Health through the Grant 1R25MD011714, the National Science Foundation through grant IIS-1817239, and a seed grant from the Center for Computing in Life Sciences at San Francisco State University.

The literature on the topic indicates that there is not enough research on including diverse learning outcomes in the designs for learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand how AI and robots impact physical, social-emotional and intellectual learning outcomes through the implementation of learning designs that are guided by selected design principles. In this study, the design-based research (DBR) methodology was employed for investigating learning in naturalistic contexts. The intervention was implemented in a primary school in which learners used educational robots. The main findings reveal that the development of an integrated analytical framework, which considers a broader spectrum of human potential, allows for analyzing students' learning outcomes in a more integral, inclusive and balanced way. This, in turn, promotes students' learning by using AI and robots. Another finding reveals that the impact of using AI and robotics on learning designs is reflected in learners' personal trajectories having different pathways and paces. Finally, the lessons learned and the challenges to be overcome are summarized, and recommendations are made for future research for the enhancement of learning experiences that use AI and robotics.","[Salas-Pilco, Sdenka Zobeida] Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Educ Informat Technol, Educ Technol, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China",Central China Normal University,"Salas-Pilco, SZ (通讯作者)，Cent China Normal Univ, Sch Educ Informat Technol, 152 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",sdenkasp@mail.ccnu.edu.cn,"SALAS-PILCO, Sdenka Zobeida/B-6287-2013","SALAS-PILCO, Sdenka Zobeida/0000-0002-5752-9525",Central China Normal University; University of Hong KongUniversity of Hong Kong,"The author thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments on the early versions of this article.

However, most of these studies still focus on conceptual discussions, terminology, or the proposal for frameworks that do not take advantage of the evolution of information and communication technologies. In this paper, authors discussed the lack of tools to computationally support WS handling. In response to this lack, a computational tool was developed considering a previously published method for WS classification based on conceptual systems. This tool was applied and evaluated in experimental cases about surprising events that occurred in politics in recent years, considering traditional metrics of information retrieval.

We apply techniques from natural language processing (lexicons, word embeddings, topic models) to 15 U.S. history textbooks widely used in Texas between 2015 and 2017, studying their depiction of historically marginalized groups. We find that Latinx people are rarely discussed, and the most common famous figures are nearly all White men. Lexicon-based approaches show that Black people are described as performing actions associated with low agency and power. Word embeddings reveal that women tend to be discussed in the contexts of work and the home. Topic modeling highlights the higher prominence of political topics compared with social ones. We also find that more conservative counties tend to purchase textbooks with less representation of women and Black people.

In this study, we examine the ways in which obesity has been framed by the press over a ten-year period (2008-2017), focussing both on areas of stability and change. The analysis is based on a similar to 36 million-word database of all UK newspaper articles mentioning the words 'obese' or 'obesity' published within this time frame and draws upon techniques from corpus linguistics - a collection of computational methods for examining recurrent linguistic patterns in large bodies of language data. Our analysis shows that, over time, obesity is represented increasingly as a biomedical problem that is both caused and should be prevented by individual action. Meanwhile, focus on wider environmental determinants of health, including the role of Government and the food industry, decreases over time. In the paper, we situate these trends within the wider context of UK society and argue that they both represent the increasing dominance of neoliberal models of health but also have the potential to contribute to weight stigma and the blaming of individuals. Accordingly, it is argued that the press should seek greater balance in its reporting of the potential causes of and solutions to obesity, as well as closer alignment with scientific evidence. By doing so, the press could begin to report on obesity in a way that raises useful public awareness around the topic and which challenges some of the stigma that currently attends to this social justice issue.","[Baker, Paul; Brookes, Gavin; Atanasova, Dimitrinka] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster, England; [Flint, Stuart W.] Univ Leeds, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",Lancaster University; University of Leeds,"Brookes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, ESRC Ctr Corpus Approaches Social Sci, Bailrigg House, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",g.j.brookes@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Atanasova, Dimitrinka/0000-0003-3474-8909; Baker, Paul/0000-0001-6743-4020; Flint, Stuart/0000-0003-4878-3019; Brookes, Gavin/0000-0003-0726-2559",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science [ES/R008906/1]; ESRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/R008906/1] Funding Source: UKRI,"This research was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Corpus Approaches to Social Science, grant number ES/R008906/1.

EVIDENCE FROM A FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH DIGITAL TRACE DATA,PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VOTING ADVICE APPLICATIONS; POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE; PREFERENCES; IMPACT; PANEL,"Voting Advice Applications (VAAs), which provide citizens with information on the party that best represents their political preferences, are often cited as evidence of the empowering capabilities of digital tools. Aside from the informational benefits of these voter guides, observational studies have suggested a strong effect on political participation and vote choice. However, existing impact evaluations have been limited by a reliance on convenience samples, lack of random assignment, or both. This raises questions about self-selection and the precise mechanisms underlying how voters learn about politics. Here, we provide evidence from a field experiment with survey outcomes conducted with a sample of over 1,000 German citizens in the 2017 federal election campaign. Using linked panel survey and digital trace data combined with a randomized encouragement to complete a VAA, we assess respondents' compliance with treatment and observe how the use of this tool affects political behavior, attitudes, media consumption, political knowledge, and even social media activity. Our findings reveal that the overwhelming consensus in favor of positive effects on turnout and vote choice should be treated with caution, as we find no such effects. Rather, the actual virtue of VAAs in a complex online information environment lies in increasing knowledge about parties' positions on issues-exactly the kind of information these tools were designed to provide.","[Munzert, Simon] Hertie Sch, Data Sci & Publ Policy, Berlin, Germany; [Barbera, Pablo] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Guess, Andrew] Princeton Univ, Polit & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Yang, Junghwan] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL USA",University of Southern California; Princeton University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Munzert, S (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch, Friedrichstr 180, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",munzert@hertie-school.org,"Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848","Volkswagen Foundation Computational Social Science Initiative [92 143]; Princeton University Institutional Review BoardPrinceton University [8327, 10014, 10041]","SIMON MUNZERT is an assistant professor of data science and public policy at the Hertie School in Berlin, Germany.

Here we quantify the impact of 6,068 hierarchically coded NPIs implemented in 79 territories on the effective reproduction number, R-t, of COVID-19. We propose a modelling approach that combines four computational techniques merging statistical, inference and artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with two external datasets recording 42,151 additional NPIs from 226 countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown). Using country-specific 'what-if' scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions. Analysing over 50,000 government interventions in more than 200 countries, Haug et al. find that combinations of softer measures, such as risk communication or those increasing healthcare capacity, can be almost as effective as disruptive lockdowns.","[Haug, Nils; Dervic, Elma; Thurner, Stefan; Klimek, Peter] Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, CeMSIIS, Vienna, Austria; [Haug, Nils; Geyrhofer, Lukas; Dervic, Elma; Desvars-Larrive, Amelie; Loreto, Vittorio; Pinior, Beate; Thurner, Stefan; Klimek, Peter] Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Londei, Alessandro; Loreto, Vittorio] Sony Comp Sci Labs, Paris, France; [Desvars-Larrive, Amelie; Pinior, Beate] Univ Vet Med, Inst Food Safety Food Technol & Vet Publ Hlth, Unit Vet Publ Hlth & Epidemiol, Vienna, Austria; [Loreto, Vittorio] Sapienza Univ Rome, Phys Dept, Rome, Italy; [Thurner, Stefan] Santa Fe Inst, Santa Fe, NM 87501 USA",Medical University of Vienna; University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna; Sapienza University Rome; The Santa Fe Institute,"Klimek, P (通讯作者)，Med Univ Vienna, Sect Sci Complex Syst, CeMSIIS, Vienna, Austria.; Klimek, P (通讯作者)，Complex Sci Hub Vienna, Vienna, Austria.",peter.klimek@meduniwien.ac.at,"; Conrady, Beate/O-8547-2017","Desvars-Larrive, Amelie/0000-0001-7671-696X; Conrady, Beate/0000-0001-8554-5963; Haug, Nina/0000-0002-5130-9193; Dervic, Elma/0000-0001-7168-3310; Londei, Alessandro/0000-0002-5748-9578","Austrian Science Promotion Agency; FFG project [857136]; Medizinisch-Wissenschaftlichen Fonds des Burgermeisters der Bundeshauptstadt Wien [CoVid004]; Austrian Federal Ministry of Social Affairs, Health, Care and Consumer Protection; University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna; Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety; WWTF [COV 20-001, COV 20-017, MA16-045]","We thank A.

For digital humans to be effective and engaging in these roles, it is important they can build close relationships with people. Emotional expressiveness can improve social closeness in human relationships, especially for females. However, it is unknown whether multimodal emotional expression improves relationships with digital humans. Participants were 185 adults aged 18 years or older with English fluency. Participants were block-randomized by gender to complete the Relationship Closeness Induction Task with one of six versions of a digital human. The digital humans varied in modality richness (face, no face) and emotional expression (emotional voice, neutral voice; emotional face, neutral face). Participants' language was analysed for emotional content using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. A series of three-way ANOVA and ANCOVA were conducted to evaluate the effect of digital human face type, voice type, and participant gender on emotional content in participant language. A digital human with no face was associated with more first-person singular pronoun use than a neutral face and an emotional face digital human. A digital human with no face and a neutral voice received more general negative emotion language than a digital human with no face and an emotional voice. Findings suggest the presence of a face and emotion in the voice may improve emotional responses to digital humans.

Using computational linguistics, we analysed spoken utterances from a sample of hubristic CEOs and compared them with non-hubristic CEOs. We found that hubristic CEOs' linguistic utterances show systematic and consistent differences from the linguistic utterances of non-hubristic CEOs. Demonstrating how hubristic leadership manifests in CEO language contributes to wider research regarding the diagnosis and prevention of the unethical and potentially destructive effects of hubristic leadership. This research contributes to the wider study of hubris and unethical leadership by applying a novel method for identifying linguistic markers and offers a way of militating against the risk of unethical and destructive CEO behaviours induced or aggravated by hubristic leadership.","[Akstinaite, Vita] Murdoch Univ, Coll Arts Business Law & Social Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Robinson, Graham; Sadler-Smith, Eugene] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford, Surrey, England",Murdoch University; University of Surrey,"Akstinaite, V (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Coll Arts Business Law & Social Sci, Perth, WA, Australia.",vita.akstinaite@murdoch.edu.au,,"Akstinaite, Vita/0000-0003-0313-7187",,,,119,9,9,6,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

Automatic content analysis was employed to examine disease topics, risks, and cost consequences, thus providing lay people with a chance of learning the etiology of NCDs and information available for fighting diseases. The result of the computational method identified a total of 152,810 news articles with one of the seven supra-categories of NCDs. The category of metabolic diseases was covered most frequently in the past ten years. Three health risks received ample attention in all 11 newspapers: stress burden, tobacco use, and genetic predispositions. The results evidenced how media framed risk information of illnesses would distort the way in which diseases were selected, interpreted, and the outcome communicated.

We rely on previously developed automatic text analysis system and the F-2 companion robot control system. The system can receive text in natural language, create its semantic representation, and select a processing script for transmitting the behavioral response to the robot. A primitive computer agent will select only the first, the most relevant, script and exclude all other scripts from consideration. In contrast, a more intelligent algorithm will process multiple scripts at once and will be able to use irrelevant scripts as material for ironic responses, for multiple representations of an event, for imagination or for simulation of another person's actions and knowledge. A key feature of the proposed minimal architecture of consciousness, in our opinion, is that processing scripts of the higher-level should have access to a variety of scripts activated on the first stage of processing, including even irrelevant scripts and representations.","[Kotob, A.

However, cutting, one of the most common intentional forms of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), is relatively often shared publicly via new digital media technologies. We explored NSSI on Instagram through a pioneering combination of two computational methods: First, we developed an automatic image-recognition algorithm that uncovered NSSI (or the absence of NSSI) in digital pictures, and second, we employed web-scraping techniques to obtain all pictures posted on Instagram in a given time frame under four NSSI-related hashtags in English and German. The image-recognition algorithm was then used to explore the relative prevalence of NSSI in theseN= 13,132 pictures posted within 48 hr on Instagram under #cutting (n= 4,219), #suicide (n= 7,910), #selbstmord (n= 173), and #ritzen (n= 830) in June 2018. This article not only aims to raise awareness of NSSI on Instagram but also introduces the first automatic image-recognition algorithm that addresses cutting on social media and presents that algorithm's first empirical test run on a large sample of pictures scraped from Instagram. The ultimate goal of this research is to protect vulnerable populations from contact with NSSI-related pictures posted on social media.","[Scherr, Sebastian; Oramas, Jose M.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Frissen, Thomas] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Leuven, Belgium; [Arendt, Florian] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",League of European Research Universities - LERU; KU Leuven; League of European Research Universities - LERU; KU Leuven; University of Vienna,"Scherr, S (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",sebastian.scherr@kuleuven.be; florian.arendt@univie.ac.at; thomas.frissen@kuleuven.be; jose.oramas@kuleuven.be,"Oramas, José/AAA-5521-2021; Scherr, Sebastian/ABE-5525-2020","Oramas, José/0000-0002-8607-5067; Scherr, Sebastian/0000-0003-4730-1575",,,,46,14,14,4,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

To inform this debate, we investigated relationships between structural white matter connectivity and word production in a cross-sectional study of 42 participants with aphasia due to unilateral left hemisphere stroke. Specifically, we reconstructed a local connectome matrix for each participant from diffusion spectrum imaging data and regressed these matrices on indices of semantic and phonological ability derived from their responses to a picture-naming test and a computational model of word production. These connectometry analyses indicated that both dorsally located (arcuate fasciculus) and ventrally located (inferior frontal-occipital, uncinate, and middle longitudinal fasciculi) tracts were associated with semantic ability, while associations with phonological ability were more dorsally situated, including the arcuate and middle longitudinal fasciculi. Associations with limbic pathways including the posterior cingulum bundle and the fornix were also found. All analyses controlled for total lesion volume and all results showing positive associations obtained false discovery rates < 0.05. These results challenge dual-stream accounts that deny a role for the arcuate fasciculus in semantic processing, and for ventral-stream pathways in language production. They also illuminate limbic contributions to both semantic and phonological processing for word production.","[Hula, William D.; Dickey, Michael Walsh] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Geriatr Res Educ & Clin Ctr & Audiol & Speech Pat, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA; [Hula, William D.; Dresang, Haley C.; Dickey, Michael Walsh] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Panesar, Sandip; Fernandez-Miranda, Juan C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Gravier, Michelle L.] Calif State East Bay, Dept Speech Language & Hearing Sci, Hayward, CA USA; [Yeh, Fang-Cheng] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Neurol Surg, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Stanford University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Hula, WD (通讯作者)，VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Audiol & Speech Pathol, Univ Dr 112SP-U, Pittsburgh, PA 15240 USA.",william.hula@va.gov,"Yeh, Fang-Cheng/E-9698-2012","Yeh, Fang-Cheng/0000-0002-7946-2173",National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication DisordersUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R01DC013803]; Veterans Integrated Service Network 4 Competitive Pilot Project Fund,This work was supported by National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders award R01DC013803 to J.C.F-M and W.D.H. and by the Veterans Integrated Service Network 4 Competitive Pilot Project Fund.,,76,15,15,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0006-8950,1460-2156,,BRAIN,Brain,AUG,2020,143,,8,,,,2532,2544,,,,,13,Clinical Neurology; Neurosciences,,Neurosciences & Neurology,NV4SK,WOS:000574313300026,32705146,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed more than 100 million Twitter messages posted worldwide during the early stages of epidemic spread across countries (from 22 January to 10 March 2020) and classified the reliability of the news being circulated. We developed an Infodemic Risk Index to capture the magnitude of exposure to unreliable news across countries. We found that measurable waves of potentially unreliable information preceded the rise of COVID-19 infections, exposing entire countries to falsehoods that pose a serious threat to public health. As infections started to rise, reliable information quickly became more dominant, and Twitter content shifted towards more credible informational sources. Infodemic early-warning signals provide important cues for misinformation mitigation by means of adequate communication strategies. An analysis of news shared on Twitter estimates the level of infodemic risk associated with COVID-19 across countries. Epidemic spread and infodemic risk co-evolve, with reliable information becoming more dominant as infection rates rise locally.","[Gallotti, Riccardo; Valle, Francesco; Castaldo, Nicola; De Domenico, Manlio] Fdn Bruno Kessler, CoMuNe Lab, Trento, Italy; [Sacco, Pierluigi] IULM Univ, Milan, Italy; [Sacco, Pierluigi] Fdn Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy",Fondazione Bruno Kessler; IULM International University Languages & Media; Fondazione Bruno Kessler,"De Domenico, M (通讯作者)，Fdn Bruno Kessler, CoMuNe Lab, Trento, Italy.; Sacco, P (通讯作者)，IULM Univ, Milan, Italy.; Sacco, P (通讯作者)，Fdn Bruno Kessler, Trento, Italy.",pierluigi.sacco@iulm.it; mdedomenico@fbk.eu,"De Domenico, Manlio/AAH-3083-2021; De Domenico, Manlio/B-5826-2014; Gallotti, Riccardo/B-6339-2013","De Domenico, Manlio/0000-0001-5158-8594; De Domenico, Manlio/0000-0001-5158-8594; Castaldo, Nicola/0000-0002-2034-4033; Gallotti, Riccardo/0000-0002-8088-1973",FBK's Digital Society Department; FBK's Flagship Project CHUB (Computational Human Behavior),We received no specific funding for this work.

In this paper, a hybrid deep learning model bidirectional long short term memory-convolutional neural network (BiLSTM-CNN) is proposed for short-term wind power forecasting. First, the grey correlation analysis is utilized to select the inputs for forecasting model; Then, the proposed hybrid model extracts multi-dimension features of inputs to predict the wind power from the temporal-spatial perspective, where the Bi-LSTM model is utilized to mine the bidirectional temporal characteristics while the convolution and pooling operations of CNN are utilized to extract the spatial characteristics from multiple input time series. Lastly, a case study is conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed model. Other deep learning models (Bi-LSTM, LSTM, CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM) are also simulated to conduct comparison from three aspects. The results show that the BiLSTM-CNN model has the best accuracy with the lowest RMSE of 2.5492, MSE of 6.4984, MAE of 1.7344 and highest R-2 of 0.9929. CNN has the fastest speed with an average computational time of 0.0741s. The hybrid model that mines the spatial feature based on the extracted temporal feature has a better performance than the model mines the temporal feature based on the extracted spatial feature.","[Zhen, Hao; Niu, Dongxiao; Yu, Min; Wang, Keke; Xu, Xiaomin] North China Elect Power Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Zhen, Hao; Niu, Dongxiao; Yu, Min; Wang, Keke; Xu, Xiaomin] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing Key Lab New Energy & Low Carbon Dev, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Liang, Yi] Hebei Geo Univ, Sch Management, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; North China Electric Power University; Hebei GEO University,"Liang, Y (通讯作者)，Hebei Geo Univ, Sch Management, Shijiazhuang 050031, Hebei, Peoples R China.",mailofzhenhao@163.com; ndx@ncepu.edu.cn; ncepuym@163.com; wk915783810@163.com; louisliang@hgu.edu.cn; xuxiaomin0701@126.com,"Liang, Yi/AAN-7262-2021","Liang, Yi/0000-0003-3760-4433","Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education, ChinaMinistry of Education, China [18JZD032]; 111 Project, Ministry of Science and Technology of People's Republic of China [B18021]; Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71804045]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [G2020403008]; Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Hebei Education Department, China [SQ201097]","This work is supported by the 2018 Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences Research, Ministry of Education, China (Project No. 18JZD032), 111 Project, Ministry of Science and Technology of People's Republic of China (Project No. B18021), Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71804045), Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province, China (Project No. G2020403008) and Humanities and Social Science Research Project of Hebei Education Department, China (Project No. SQ201097).",,43,7,7,19,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9490,10.3390/su12229490,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ8UX,WOS:000595195400001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel Markov switching method is proposed for identifying currency crisis based on two states model, the turmoil state and tranquil state, which is the most suitable model considering the balance between model performance and computational demand. Compared with previous Markov switching currency crisis studies, the contribution of this paper comes from several ways. First, the dependent variable is different. While other papers use the exchange rate directly or the estimation of devaluation probability, this study uses the market pressure index calculated from nominal exchange rate and foreign reserves. Secondly, we allow different volatilities in different states, whereas other papers assume the same volatility in two states. Thirdly, our transition probabilities are constant rather than time-varying. The model shows evidence of state switching before crisis in many different currency markets. Lastly, we compare the Markov switching method with the widely used probit model which proposed an early warning system in terms of forecasting performance, and the empirical results show that the novel Markov switching method performs better than the probit model.","[Du, Jiangze] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Finance, Nanchang, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Yu, Runfang] Hong Kong Appl Sci & Technol Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Xidian Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Xian, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kin Keung] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Ind & Mfg Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Hong Kong Applied Science & Technology Research Institute Company Limited (ASTRI); Xidian University; University of Hong Kong,"Yu, RF (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Appl Sci & Technol Res Inst, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jiangzedu@jxufe.edu.cn; cityuhao@gmail.com; mskklai@outlook.com,"Lai, Kin Keung/AEB-4278-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71471029, 71561012, 71661011]; Humanities and Social Sciences Key Research Base Project in Jiangxi Province of China [JD16055]; Science and Technology Project of Education Department in Jiangxi Province of China [GJJ150469]","The authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to the editor and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions, which helped to improve the quality of the paper tremendously.

There is evidence that children can gain insight into ToM through experience, including language training and explanatory interactions. But this still leaves open the question ofhowchildren gain these insights-what processes drive this learning? We propose that analogical comparison is a key mechanism in the development of ToM. In Experiment 1, children were shown true- and false-belief scenarios and prompted to engage in multiple comparisons (e.g., belief vs. world). In Experiments 2a, 2b, and 3, children saw a series of true- and false-belief events, varying in order and in their alignability. Across these experiments, we found that providing support for comparing true- and false-belief scenarios led to increased performance on false-belief tests. These findings show that analogical comparison can support ToM learning.","[Hoyos, Christian; Horton, William S.; Gentner, Dedre] Northwestern Univ, Dept Psychol, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Simms, Nina K.] Northwestern Univ, Spatial Intelligence & Learning, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Gentner, D (通讯作者)，Dept Psychol, 2029 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",gentner@northwestern.edu,,,ONROffice of Naval Research [N00014-16-1-2613]; NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-0824162],"We thank the families and preschools who participated in the research; Ashley Isaia, Emma Bulzoni, and Katie Cha for help with data collection; Sue Hespos, Erin Anderson, and members of the Cognition and Language Lab for comments and discussion; and Ken Forbus, Irina Rabkina, and Constantine Nakos for discussions of computational mechanisms.

The data mining technology was used to establish a credit risk assessment model of personal to personal peer-to-peer (P2P) network lending, and then the credit situation of the lender was accurately assessed to reduce the risk of the platform. Firstly, the loan data of LendingClub (LC) platform in 2018 were collected and sorted out, and then the unbalanced data set was obtained through preprocessing. Secondly, the unbalanced data set was sampled by layers, and 10 balanced data sets were obtained, and the four indexes of evaluation were obtained through data classification, that is, P2P platform credit rating evaluation index. Finally, the actual data of LC platform were evaluated by decision tree and binomial logic regression algorithm. The CfsSubsetEval evaluation strategy and BestFirst search strategy were used to search for a single feature to improve the prediction ability, so as to analyze the credit rating of the lender. The research results showed that the decision tree algorithm could improve the accuracy of preliminary screening, and predict the default probability of borrowers more accurately, so as to filter out the borrowers with higher default rate and reduce the loan risk of the platform, while the binomial logistic regression algorithm could show good performance. The combination of the two algorithms can truly estimate the credit status of the lenders and improve the transaction efficiency. Therefore, the research on the credit risk of blockchain platform based on data mining technology is of great significance to improve the credit level of investors, improve their investment income, save transaction costs, optimize the allocation of credit resources, and achieve effective supervision by credit regulatory authorities.

This was made urgent by incidents like a live-stream interview of renowned British conspiracy theorist David Icke-in which he falsely linked the spread of the coronavirus to 5G technology-that gained substantial traction online. Behind these events, however, lies a tension between the need for authoritative medical information and the socio-technical mediation that enables multiple, competing voices to lay claim to such authority on YouTube; a tension exacerbated by the current pandemic. Following an investigation into the sources and types of video content average users were likely to see when searching for information about the coronavirus on the site, we suggest that through its incentive structure and participatory affordances, YouTube may have subordinated expertise to a logic of likability-leaving institutional experts trailing behind.","[Marchal, Nahema] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 3JS, England; [Au, Hubert] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Social Data Sci, Oxford, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Marchal, N (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",nahema.marchal@oii.ox.ac.uk,,"Marchal, Nahema/0000-0002-8518-3840",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [648311]; Ford Foundation; Hewlett; Adessium; Luminate; University of Oxford's Research Ethics Committee [CUREC OII C1A 15-044],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Research Council for the project Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe, Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

In addition, they represent an untapped resource for studying the effects of gender on the doctor-patient relationship. Understanding gender differences in online reviews is important because it may impact the value of those reviews to patients. Documenting gender differences in patient experience may also help to improve the doctor-patient relationship. This is the first large-scale study of physician reviews to extensively investigate gender bias in online reviews or offer recommendations for improvements to online review systems to correct for gender bias and aid patients in selecting a physician. Objective: This study examines 154,305 reviews from across the United States for all medical specialties. Our analysis includes a qualitative and quantitative examination of review content and physician rating with regard to doctor and reviewer gender. Methods: A total of 154,305 reviews were sampled from Google Place reviews. Reviewer and doctor gender were inferred from names. Reviews were coded for overall patient experience (negative or positive) by collapsing a 5-star scale and coded for general categories (process, positive/negative soft skills), which were further subdivided into themes. Computational text processing methods were employed to apply this codebook to the entire data set, rendering it tractable to quantitative methods. Specifically, we estimated binary regression models to examine relationships between physician rating, patient experience themes, physician gender, and reviewer gender). Results: Female reviewers wrote 60% more reviews than men. Male reviewers were more likely to give negative reviews (odds ratio [OR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.19; P<.001). Reviews of female physicians were considerably more negative than those of male physicians (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.94-2.14; P<.001). Soft skills were more likely to be mentioned in the reviews written by female reviewers and about female physicians. Negative reviews of female doctors were more likely to mention candor (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.82; P<.001) and amicability (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.47-1.90; P<.001). Disrespect was associated with both female physicians (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.35-1.51; P<.001) and female reviewers (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.19-1.35; P<.001). Female patients were less likely to report disrespect from female doctors than expected from the base ORs (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04-1.32; P=.008), but this effect overrode only the effect for female reviewers. Conclusions: This work reinforces findings in the extensive literature on gender differences and gender bias in patient-physician interaction. Its novel contribution lies in highlighting gender differences in online reviews. These reviews inform patients' choice of doctor and thus affect both patients and physicians. The evidence of gender bias documented here suggests review sites may be improved by providing information about gender differences, controlling for gender when presenting composite ratings for physicians, and helping users write less biased reviews.","[Dunivin, Zackary; Siek, Katie] Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN USA; [Zadunayski, Lindsay] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Troy, NY USA; [Baskota, Ujjwal] Jackson State Univ, Jackson, MS USA; [Mankoff, Jennifer] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Jackson State University; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Mankoff, J (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Bill & Melinda Gates Ctr Comp Sci & Engn, 3800 E Stevens Way NE, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",jmankoffg@acm.org,,"Mankoff, Jennifer/0000-0001-9235-5324; Zadunayski, Lindsay/0000-0002-6989-356X; Dunivin, Zackary/0000-0002-1860-7199",,,,46,3,3,1,8,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

However, their contribution also highlights the need for establishing codes of practice for computational text analysis. In this perspective, we discuss five areas for improvement when treating text as big data in light of guiding principles from computational research - transparency, reproducibility and validation - to facilitate rigorous research practice: (1) full transparency over data collection and corpus construction, (2) comprehensive method descriptions that enable reproducibility by other researchers, (3) application of rigorous model validation procedures, (4) results interpretation based on primary text and clear research design and (5) critical discussion and contextualization of main findings. We conclude that the energy social science community needs to develop codes of practice to build on the promising research within the field of computational text analysis and suggest first steps into this direction.","[Mueller-Hansen, Finn; Callaghan, Max W.; Minx, Jan C.] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, EUREF Campus 19,Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany; [Mueller-Hansen, Finn] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Callaghan, Max W.; Minx, Jan C.] Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Priestley Int Ctr Climate, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; University of Leeds,"Muller-Hansen, F (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, EUREF Campus 19,Torgauer Str 12-15, D-10829 Berlin, Germany.",mueller-hansen@mcc-berlin.net,,"Muller-Hansen, Finn/0000-0002-0425-1996",German Ministry of Research and EducationFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [03EK3046B]; Heinrich Boll Foundation,This work was developed within the project 'Strategic Scenario Analysis' (START) funded by the German Ministry of Research and Education (grant reference: 03EK3046B).

For public health agencies, understanding the driving forces of web-based discussions will help deliver more effective and efficient information to general users on social media and the web. Objective: The study aimed to identify the major contributors that drove overall Zika-related tweeting dynamics during the 2016 epidemic. In total, 3 hypothetical drivers were proposed: (1) the underlying Zika epidemic quantified as a time series of case counts; (2) sporadic but critical real-world events such as the 2016 Rio Olympics and World Health Organization's Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) announcement, and (3) a few influential users' tweeting activities. Methods: All tweets and retweets (RTs) containing the keyword Zika posted in 2016 were collected via the Gnip application programming interface (API). We developed an analytical pipeline, EventPeriscope, to identify co-occurring trending events with Zika and quantify the strength of these events. We also retrieved Zika case data and identified the top influencers of the Zika discussion on Twitter. The influence of 3 potential drivers was examined via a multivariate time series analysis, signal processing, a content analysis, and text mining techniques. Results: Zika-related tweeting dynamics were not significantly correlated with the underlying Zika epidemic in the United States in any of the four quarters in 2016 nor in the entire year. Instead, peaks of Zika-related tweeting activity were strongly associated with a few critical real-world events, both planned, such as the Rio Olympics, and unplanned, such as the PHEIC announcement. The Rio Olympics was mentioned in >15% of all Zika-related tweets and PHEIC occurred in 27% of Zika-related tweets around their respective peaks. In addition, the overall tweeting dynamics of the top 100 most actively tweeting users on the Zika topic, the top 100 users receiving most RTs, and the top 100 users mentioned were the most highly correlated to and preceded the overall tweeting dynamics, making these groups of users the potential drivers of tweeting dynamics. The top 100 users who retweeted the most were not critical in driving the overall tweeting dynamics. There were very few overlaps among these different groups of potentially influential users. Conclusions: Using our proposed analytical workflow, EventPeriscope, we identified that Zika discussion dynamics on Twitter were decoupled from the actual disease epidemic in the United States but were closely related to and highly influenced by certain sporadic real-world events as well as by a few influential users. This study provided a methodology framework and insights to better understand the driving forces of web-based public discourse during health emergencies. Therefore, health agencies could deliver more effective and efficient web-based communications in emerging crises.","[Safarnejad, Lida; Ge, Yaorong; Krishnan, Siddharth] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Comp & Informat, Charlotte, NC USA; [Xu, Qian] Elon Univ, Sch Commun, Elon, NC USA; [Bagavathi, Arunkumar] Oklahoma State Univ, Oklahoma City, OK USA; [Chen, Shi] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Elon University; Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Chen, S (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Hlth & Human Serv, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",schen56@uncc.edu,"Bagavathi, Arunkumar/ABE-2869-2020","Bagavathi, Arunkumar/0000-0002-7135-4602; Xu, Qian/0000-0002-2354-0208",Faculty Research and Development Sabbatical at Elon University,"The authors thank the Data Science Initiative (DSI) of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for archiving and providing the raw Twitter data through the Gnip API.

Yet, very few studies have investigated the impact of incorrect information on individual and collective decisions. We performed experiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities, before and after receiving social information. Unbeknownst to them, we controlled the degree of inaccuracy of the social information through 'virtual influencers', who provided some incorrect information. We find that a large proportion of individuals only partially follow the social information, thus resisting incorrect information. Moreover, incorrect information can help improve group performance more than correct information, when going against a human underestimation bias. We then design a computational model whose predictions are in good agreement with the empirical data, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying our results. Besides these main findings, we demonstrate that the dispersion of estimates varies a lot between quantities, and must thus be considered when normalizing and aggregating estimates of quantities that are very different in nature. Overall, our results suggest that incorrect information does not necessarily impair the collective wisdom of groups, and can even be used to dampen the negative effects of known cognitive biases.","[Jayles, Bertrand; Sire, Clement] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier UPS, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Lab Phys Theor, Toulouse, France; [Jayles, Bertrand; Escobedo, Ramon; Theraulaz, Guy] Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier Ups, Ctr Rech Cognit Anim, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Ctr Biol Integrat, Toulouse, France; [Jayles, Bertrand] Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rational, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Cezera, Stephane; Blanchet, Adrien] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, INRA, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Blanchet, Adrien; Theraulaz, Guy] Inst Adv Study Toulouse, F-31015 Toulouse, France; [Kameda, Tatsuya] Univ Tokyo, Dept Social Psychol, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Max Planck Society; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of Tokyo,"Jayles, B (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier UPS, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Lab Phys Theor, Toulouse, France.; Jayles, B (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Paul Sabatier Ups, Ctr Rech Cognit Anim, Ctr Natl Rech Sci CNRS, Ctr Biol Integrat, Toulouse, France.; Jayles, B (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Human Dev, Ctr Adapt Rational, Lentzeallee 94, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",jayles@mpib-berlin.mpg.de,"Sire, Clément/X-1397-2019; Theraulaz, Guy/H-8464-2016; Jayles, Bertrand/AAX-4028-2021","Sire, Clément/0000-0003-4089-4013; Theraulaz, Guy/0000-0002-3062-4215; Jayles, Bertrand/0000-0002-4550-7919; Escobedo, Ramon/0000-0002-9945-0460","Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR)European Commission [11-IDEX-0002-02]; CNRS Mission for Interdisciplinarity (project SmartCrowd) [AMI S2C3]; Program Investissements d'Avenir under Agence Nationale de la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [11-IDEX-0002-02, ANR-10-LABX-0037]; CNRSCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)European Commission; Marie Curie Core/Program Grant Funding Grant SmartMass [655235]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16H06324, JP25118004]","This work was supported by Agence Nationale de la Recherche project 11-IDEX-0002-02-Transversalite-Multi-Disciplinary Study of Emergence Phenomena, a grant from the CNRS Mission for Interdisciplinarity (project SmartCrowd, AMI S2C3), and by Program Investissements d'Avenir under Agence Nationale de la Recherche program 11-IDEX-0002-02, reference ANR-10-LABX-0037-NEXT.

Specifically, we focus on how mental representations of message content drive its spread. Our model is based on fuzzy-trace theory (FTT), a leading theory of decision under risk. Per FTT, online content is mentally represented in two ways: verbatim (objective, but decontextualized, facts), and gist (subjective, but meaningful, interpretation). Although encoded in parallel, gist tends to drive behaviors more strongly than verbatim representations for most individuals. Our model uses factors derived from FTT to make predictions regarding which content is more likely to be shared, namely: (a) different levels of mental representation, (b) the motivational content of a message, (c) difficulty of information processing (e.g., the ease with which a given message may be comprehended and, therefore, its gist extracted), and (d) social values.","[Broniatowski, David A.] George Washington Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 800 22nd St NW 2700, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Reyna, Valerie F.] Cornell Univ, Ctr Behav Econ & Decis Res, Human Neurosci Inst, Ithaca, NY USA; [Reyna, Valerie F.] Cornell Univ, Cornell Magnet Resonance Image Facil, Ithaca, NY USA",George Washington University; Cornell University; Cornell University,"Broniatowski, DA (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Dept Engn Management & Syst Engn, 800 22nd St NW 2700, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",broniatowski@gwu.edu,,"Broniatowski, David/0000-0002-3302-9497",NIGMS NIH HHSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01 GM114771] Funding Source: Medline,,,93,2,2,1,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-298X,1572-9346,,COMPUT MATH ORGAN TH,Comput.

Initially, support vector machine (SVM) based classification model is applied to classify the product reviews. Then, confusion matrix is generated to consider the possibilities of every consumer purchasing the product. Next, K-means clustering technique is applied to cluster the available data into two groups. At the next stage, sentimental analysis approach is employed to extracting the features. Finally, fuzzy based soft set theory is applied to determine the possibility of the customer to purchase the product effectively. The experimental validation of the presented model takes place on ipod dataset. The simulation outcome pointed out the superior characteristics of the presented model under several aspects.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists' intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that human-machine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.","[Van, Nguyen Thi Thanh] Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol & Educ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Vrana, Vasiliki] Int Hellen Univ, Dept Business Adm, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece; [Duy, Nguyen Thien] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Adm Off, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Minh, Doan Xuan Huy] Inst Computat Sci & Technol, SBI Bldg,Tan Chanh Hiep Ward,Dist 12, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Dzung, Pham Tien] Univ Econ Ho Chi Minh City, Inst Dev Econ Res, 279 Nguyen Tri Phuong St,Ward 5,Dist 10, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam; [Mondal, Subhra R.; Das, Subhankar] Teerthanker Mahaveer Univ, Dept Digital Mkt, Moradabad 244001, UP, India",HCMC University of Technology & Education (HCMUTE); International Hellenic University; Teerthanker Mahaveer University,"Van, NTT (通讯作者)，Ho Chi Minh City Univ Technol & Educ, Fac Econ, Ho Chi Minh City 700000, Vietnam.; Vrana, V (通讯作者)，Int Hellen Univ, Dept Business Adm, Thessaloniki 57001, Greece.; Mondal, SR; Das, S (通讯作者)，Teerthanker Mahaveer Univ, Dept Digital Mkt, Moradabad 244001, UP, India.",vanntt@hcmute.edu.vn; vrana@ihu.gr; thienduy@ueh.edu.vn; minh.dxh@icst.org.vn; dungpt@ueh.edu.vn; nm120617@gmail.com; xd5483803@gmail.com,"DAS, SUBHANKAR/G-9554-2015","DAS, SUBHANKAR/0000-0001-7344-4583",Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Science and Technology (HCMC-DOST); Institute for Computational Science and Technology (ICST) under the project: Research The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (Ai) on Using Tourism Products And Services In Ho Chi Minh City: Application of Research on Consumer Behavior Through The Impact of [33/2020/HD-QPTKHCN],This research was funded by Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Science and Technology (HCMC-DOST) and the Institute for Computational Science and Technology (ICST) under the project: Research The Impact of Artificial Intelligence (Ai) on Using Tourism Products And Services In Ho Chi Minh City: Application of Research on Consumer Behavior Through The Impact of Technology: Funding grant contract number: 33/2020/HD-QPTKHCN; dated 6 July 2020.,,121,7,8,18,60,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2020,12,22,,,,,,,9523,10.3390/su12229523,,,30,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OZ0IE,WOS:000594619200001,,gold,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,,

In artificial intelligence, one approach for intention recognition is to use a model of possible behaviour to rate intentions as more likely if they are a better 'fit' to actions observed so far. In this paper, we draw from literature linking gaze and visual attention, and we propose a novel model of online human intention recognition that combines gaze and model-based AI planning to build probability distributions over a set of possible intentions. In human-behavioural experiments (n = 40) involving a multi-player board game, we demonstrate that adding gaze-based priors to model-based intention recognition improved the accuracy of intention recognition by 22% (p < 0.05), determined those intentions approximate to 90 seconds earlier (p < 0.05), and at no additional computational cost. We also demonstrate that, when evaluated in the presence of semi-rational or deceptive gaze behaviours, the proposed model is significantly more accurate (9% improvement) (p < 0.05) compared to a model-based or gaze only approaches. Our results indicate that the proposed model could be used to design novel human-agent interactions in cases when we are unsure whether a person is honest, deceitful, or semi-rational.

Recent data suggests that executive processes that regulate access to semantic knowledge (i.e., semantic control) are critical for maintaining coherence during speech. To test this hypothesis, we assessed speech coherence in a case-series of stroke patients who exhibited deficits in semantic control. Patients were asked to speak about a series of topics and their responses were analysed using computational linguistic methods to derive measures of their global coherence (the degree to which they spoke about the topic given) and local coherence (the degree to which they maintained a topic from one utterance to the next). Compared with age-matched controls, patients showed severe impairments to global coherence but not to local coherence. Global coherence was strongly correlated with the patients' performance on tests of semantic control, with greater semantic control deficits associated with poorer ability to maintain global coherence. Other aspects of speech production were also impaired but were not significantly correlated with semantic control deficits. These results suggest that semantic control deficits give rise to speech that is poorly regulated at the macrolinguistic message level. The preservation of local coherence in the patients suggests that automatic activation of semantic associations is relatively intact, such that each utterance they produce is connected meaningfully to the next. However, in the absence of control processes to constrain semantic activation, the content of their speech becomes increasingly distant from the original topic of discourse. This study is the first to investigate the impact of semantic control impairments on speech production at the discourse level and suggests that patients with these impairments are likely to have difficulties maintaining coherence in conversation.","[Hoffman, Paul] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cogdell-Brooke, Lucy; Thompson, Hannah E.] Univ Surrey, Sch Psychol, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Edinburgh; University of Surrey,"Hoffman, P (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Ctr Cognit Ageing & Cognit Epidemiol, Dept Psychol, 7 George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9JZ, Midlothian, Scotland.",p.hoffman@ed.ac.uk,"Hoffman, Paul/ABC-7706-2021","Hoffman, Paul/0000-0002-3248-3225","University of Edinburgh Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, part of the cross council Lifelong Health and Wellbeing Initiative [MR/K026992/1]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Medical Research Council (MRC)UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); Wellcome Trust through the Centre for Chronic Diseases and Disorders (C2D2) at the University of YorkWellcome Trust [105624]; MRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC) [G0700704] Funding Source: UKRI","PH was supported by The University of Edinburgh Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, part of the cross council Lifelong Health and Wellbeing Initiative (MR/K026992/1).

Little is known about the influence of antipsychotic medication on these symptoms. Using computational language methods, this study evaluated the impact of high versus low dopamine D(2)receptor (D2R) occupancy antipsychotics on language disturbances in 41 patients with schizophrenia, relative to 40 healthy controls. Patients with high versus low D2R occupancy antipsychotics differed by total number of words and type-token ratio, suggesting medication effects. Both patient groups differed from the healthy controls on percentage of time speaking and clauses per utterance, suggesting illness effects. Overall, more severe negative language disturbances (i.e. slower articulation rate, increased pausing, and shorter utterances) were seen in the patients that used high D2R occupancy antipsychotics, while less prominent disturbances were seen in low D2R occupancy patients. Language analyses successfully predicted drug type (sensitivity = 80.0%, specificity = 76.5%). Several language disturbances were more related to drug type and dose, than to other psychotic symptoms, suggesting that language disturbances may be aggravated by high D2R antipsychotics. This negative impact of high D2R occupancy drugs may have clinical implications, as impaired language production predicts functional outcome and degrades the quality of life.","[de Boer, J.
