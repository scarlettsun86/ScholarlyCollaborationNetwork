In the light of this mass collection of personal data, the transparency and control paradigm for personalized communication has led to increased attention from legislators and academics. However, in the scientific literature no clear definition of personalization transparency and control exists, which could lead to reliability and validity issues, impeding knowledge accumulation in academic research. In a literature review, we analyzed 31 articles and observed that: 1) no clear definitions of personalization transparency or control exist; 2) they are used interchangeably in the literature; 3) collection, processing, and sharing of data are the three objects of transparency and control; and 4) increased transparency does not automatically increase control because first awareness needs to be raised in the individual. Also, the relationship between awareness and control depends on the ability and the desire to control. This study contributes to the field of algorithmic communication by creating a common understanding of the transparency and control paradigm and thus improves validity of the results. Further, it progresses research on the issue by synthesizing existing studies on the topic, presenting the transparency-awareness-control framework, and formulating propositions to guide future research.","[Segijn, Claire] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Strycharz, Joanna] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Riegelman, Amy; Hennesy, Cody] Univ Minnesota, Univ Lib, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Strycharz, J (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",segijn@umn.edu; j.strycharz@uva.nl; aspringe@umn.edu; chennesy@umn.edu,,"Segijn, Claire/0000-0002-2424-5737; Riegelman, Amy/0000-0003-4127-5222; Hennesy, Cody/0000-0002-9410-9810",,,,48,2,2,9,9,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2021,9,4,,,,,120,133,,10.17645/mac.v9i4.4054,,,14,Communication,,Communication,XB1UT,WOS:000721120200002,,"gold, Green Published",,,44661,

We argue that affective polarization is influenced by exposure to one of the most dominant ways to cover politics: strategy coverage. While previous studies have pointed to the negative consequences of covering politicians' strategies and campaign tactics, we find that this reporting style decreases out-party hostility. Our findings are based on two separate studies: (1) a survey experiment and (2) a cross-sectional analysis that increases external validity by combining survey data with computational content analysis of the articles respondents were exposed to by their primary news sources throughout the 2016 US presidential campaign (415,604 articles from 157 American news outlets). The results demonstrate that despite the wide criticism of the tendency of journalists to focus on political strategies, such coverage may ease inter-party tensions in American politics.","[Zoizner, Alon; Shenhav, Shaul R.; Fogel-Dror, Yair] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Sheafer, Tamir] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci & Commun, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Zoizner, A (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Polit Sci, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",alon.zoizner@mail.huji.ac.il,,"Zoizner, Alon/0000-0001-5574-3475; Sheafer, Tamir/0000-0002-9242-2264; Shenhav, Shaul/0000-0002-8820-3579",Israel Science FoundationIsrael Science Foundation [1400/14],This work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation [1400/14].,,69,2,2,3,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

This approach collapses when the events of interest are hidden, overlain, or even distorted by extensive coverage of other events. One such complicated case is news about terrorism in Africa. While previous studies have started from single media hypes, we propose modeling the general pattern of such issue cycles with distributed lag models on a large-scale data basis. In order to assess the utility of distributed lag models, two basic principles of issue cycles are derived from theory and empirically tested. Furthermore, using the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone, we evaluate the usefulness of automated methods for news research. Although the data are quite noisy, automated content analysis combined with distributed lag models is a promising approach for studying issue cycles. The model can be used to visualize issue cycles. In the case of news about terrorism in Africa, we found a sudden increase in coverage, followed by a second local maximum after a few weeks.","[Juenger, Jakob; Gaertner, Chantal] Univ Greifswald, Ernst Lohmeyer Pl 3, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany",Ernst Moritz Arndt Universitat Greifswald,"Junger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Greifswald, Ernst Lohmeyer Pl 3, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany.",jakob.juenger@uni-greifswald.de,,"Junger, Jakob/0000-0003-1860-6695",,,,69,0,0,4,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings - the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp) over 16 months, with close to a quarter million online contributions regarding a political controversy in Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional polarization - homophilic versus heterophilic user interactions; (2) positional polarization - the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization - the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that political polarization on social media cannot be conceptualized as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant cross-platform differences. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), on WhatsApp, de-polarization occurred over time. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and dynamics of political polarization online.","[Yarchi, Moran] Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel; [Baden, Christian; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Noah Mozes Dept Commun & Journalism, Jerusalem, Israel",Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya; Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Yarchi, M (通讯作者)，Interdisciplinary Ctr Herzliya, Sammy Ofer Sch Commun, Kanfei Nesharim St POB 167, IL-46150 Herzliyya, Israel.",moran.yarchi@gmail.com,"Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/J-3472-2019","Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413; Kligler-Vilenchik, Neta/0000-0003-3470-3305",,,,63,40,40,27,81,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1058-4609,1091-7675,,POLIT COMMUN,Polit.

By reconceptualising affectivity beyond emotive storytelling, intentional stance-taking or evaluative expression, we propose a methodology that highlights how conventions related to mediating, modulating and managing affectivity permeate journalistic genres. Drawing from conversation analysis, Bakhtinian theory of language as dialogical and notion of affective meaning-making, we investigate how selected linguistic forms and structures - namely evidential and epistemic modals and lexical items signalling affective intensity (such as emotive and evaluative words and metaphorical expressions) - participate in affective meaning-making in news journalism. A scalable computational methodology is introduced to study multiple linguistic structures in conjunction. In investigating a case study - the news reporting and commentary on a highly charged, year-long political conflict between the right-wing conservative government and the trade unions in Finland (2015-2016) - the approach allows a focus on the ways in which affectivity operates in journalistic texts in response to both generic expectations of the audience and journalistic conventions. Our findings include identification of the intertwining of strategic rituals of objectivity and emotionality, recognition of metaphoricity as a key source of affectivity and detection of different news article types having their own conventions for managing affectivity. We also observe a connection between emotive and evaluative words and the grammatical constructions used to express degrees of certainty, which suggests these modal constructions play an important part in how affectivity informs journalistic texts.","[Koivunen, Anu] Tampere Univ, Fac Social Sci, Gender Studies, Tampere, Finland; [Kanner, Antti] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Language & Digital Humanities, Helsinki, Finland; [Janicki, Maciej] Univ Helsinki, Human Sci Comp Interact Grp, Dept Digital Humanities, Helsinki, Finland; [Harju, Auli] Tampere Univ, Media Studies, Tampere, Finland; [Hokkanen, Julius] Tampere Univ, Gender Studies, Tampere, Finland; [Makela, Eetu] Univ Helsinki, Human Sci Comp Interact, Helsinki, Finland",Tampere University; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; Tampere University; Tampere University; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki,"Koivunen, A (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ, Fac Social Sci, Tampere 33014, Finland.",anu.koivunen@tuni.fi,"Mäkelä, Eetu/E-7632-2012","Mäkelä, Eetu/0000-0002-8366-8414; Harju, Auli/0000-0002-1511-8728; Hokkanen, Julius/0000-0003-3812-0879","Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland [320286, 320677]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by The Academy of Finland [320286 and 320677].",,48,0,0,2,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAY,2021,22,5,,,SI,,1190,1206,1.4649E+15,10.1177/1464884920985724,,44228,17,Communication,,Communication,SC8RV,WOS:000621901300001,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,44661,

This article introduces the concept of 'pioneer journalism' to provide just such an analysis across different organizational contexts. Pioneer journalism is understood as a particular group of journalists that incorporates new organizational forms and experimental practice in pursuit of redefining the field and its structural foundations. To introduce this concept, the article argues along three stages. First, it develops a theoretical basis on which to pin our understanding of pioneering practice by reviewing previous research into journalism's transformation beyond the newsroom. Second, it extends the theoretical discussion into the empirical realm by looking at five extreme cases of pioneer journalists through an explorative interview analysis. Third, and to conclude, an integrated concept of pioneer journalism is outlined as a point of departure from which to further consider journalism's re-figuration more generally.","[Hepp, Andreas] Univ Bremen, ZeMKI, Ctr Media Commun & Informat Res, Media & Commun, Bremen, Germany; [Loosen, Wiebke] Leibniz Inst Media Res, Hamburg, Germany; [Loosen, Wiebke] Hans Bredow Inst HBI, Hamburg, Germany",University of Bremen,"Hepp, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Ctr Media Commun & Informat Res ZeMKI, Linzer Str 4, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",andreas.hepp@uni-bremen.de,,"Hepp, Andreas/0000-0001-7292-4147",,,,73,21,21,10,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,MAR,2021,22,3,,,,,577,595,,10.1177/1464884919829277,,,19,Communication,,Communication,QR8SC,WOS:000625482100001,,hybrid,,,44661,

This literature emphasizes the political-economic contexts of data production and predicts a heavy reliance on government data, use of national over local data, and a tendency to take data categories for granted, with inconsistent scrutiny. A content analysis of data journalism projects at legacy and non-legacy outlets reveals some support for the expectations from this literature. Findings show an increasing tendency to portray events as abstract metrics and decreasing attention to personal, lived anecdotes. Findings also show a growing tendency to provide indeterminate data sources and limited overt and accessible evidence of data scrutiny. We also see a higher percentage of national-level sourcing than local sourcing across all years, and a decline in government sourcing coupled with a rise in self-gathered, crowdsourced data online. Legacy outlets were more likely than non-legacy outlets to use local data sources, to provide anecdotal reporting in connection with the data presentation, and to use government data sources. Non-legacy outlets were more likely to produce complex abstract metrics.","[Lowrey, Wilson] Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Hou, Jue] Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Lowrey, W (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",wlowrey@ua.edu,,,,,,36,15,15,8,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JAN,2021,22,1,,,,,35,51,,10.1177/1464884918767577,,,17,Communication,,Communication,QR8FD,WOS:000625448100003,,,,,44661,

Yet one important question that persists within the fields of political science, communication, and psychology is whether appearance or substance matters more during political campaigns. To a large extent, this appearance vs. substance question remains open and, crucially, the notion that appearance can in fact effectively sway voter perceptions is consequential for the health of democracy. This study leverages advances from the fields of machine learning and computer vision to expand our knowledge on how nonverbal elements of political communication influence voters immediate impressions of political actors. We rely on video from the 4th Republican Party presidential debate held on November 10, 2016, as well as continuous response approval data from a live focus group (n = 311; 36,528 reactions), to determine how the emotional displays of political candidates influence voter impression formation. Our results suggest that anger displays can positively influence viewers' real-time evaluations. Happiness displays, on the other hand, are much less effective in eliciting a response from the viewing public, while fear displays were rarely projected by the candidates of the debate under study.","[Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Polit Dept, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Exeter Q Step Ctr, Exeter, Devon, England; [Boussalis, Constantine; Coan, Travis G.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; University of Exeter; Trinity College Dublin,"Boussalis, C (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Polit Sci, 3 Coll Green, Dublin 2, Ireland.",boussalc@tcd.ie,"Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022",,Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund] [2018-19]; UK Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/N012283/1],This work was supported by the Trinity College Dublin [Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund 2018-19].

To bypass long-term investment in developing data skills, out-of-the-box software solutions are commonly used. Newsrooms today are partially dependent on third-party platforms to build interactive and visual stories - but the business models of platforms are predisposed to changes, frequently inducing losses of stories. This article combines in-depth interviews and an ancillary survey to study the status quo and identify future challenges in embracing out-of-the-box and in-house tools, and their impact on Australian data journalism. Results indicate a dichotomy between commercial and public service media organisations. Commercial outlets are heavily reliant on out-of-the-box solutions to develop stories, due to a lack of skillsets and a shortage of skilled labour. By contrast, public service media are developing their own in-house solutions, which reflects their desire for the continuous digital preservation of data stories despite the challenges identified.","[de-Lima-Santos, Mathias-Felipe] Univ Navarra, Pamplona, Spain; [Schapals, Aljosha Karim; Bruns, Axel] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",University of Navarra; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"de-Lima-Santos, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Digital UNAV, Campus Univ, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",mdelimas@unav.es,"de-Lima-Santos, Mathias-Felipe/B-7162-2019","de-Lima-Santos, Mathias-Felipe/0000-0001-8879-7381; Schapals, Aljosha Karim/0000-0001-9512-8792",project JOLT - Harnessing Data and Technology for Journalism (H2020 - MSCA-ITN-2017) [765140]; ARCAustralian Research Council [DP160101211],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This article was partially funded by the project JOLT - Harnessing Data and Technology for Journalism (H2020 - MSCA-ITN-2017; grant number: 765140), and the ARC Discovery project DP160101211 Journalism beyond the Crisis: Emerging Forms, Practices, and Uses.",,56,7,7,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1329-878X,2200-467X,,MEDIA INT AUST,Media Int.

We employed a traditional social science survey of over 7,800 news audiences and implemented natural language processing, text-mining, and neural network analyses for 1,500 news articles concerning public affairs. Results suggest that the journalistic values of news articles are stronger predictors of audience-rated news quality than their linguistic/formal features. The impact of journalistic values overrode that of the news audience attributes which served as a baseline for comparison. Specifically, believability, depth, and diversity were more important in predicting audience-rated news quality than readability, objectivity, factuality, and sensationalism. Regarding linguistic/formal features, bylines, sources, subjective expressions, and article similarities were influential. This study provides an additional support that news audiences regard journalistic values highly as substantial factors of news quality. It also provides empirical evidence for the normative news reporting guidelines. Methodologically, it serves as an example of integrating computational and textual methods with traditional social science approach.","[Choi, Sujin] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Media, Seoul, South Korea; [Shin, Hyopil] Seoul Natl Univ, Grad Sch Data Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Seung-Shik] Kookmin Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Seoul National University (SNU); Kookmin University,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Media, Seoul, South Korea.",sujinchoi@khu.ac.kr,"Choi, Sujin/AAH-9255-2020","Choi, Sujin/0000-0002-7665-0734","Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2018S1A5A2A03035181, KHSIRB-18-069]","This study was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2018S1A5A2A03035181).

There is as yet no standard method for the unsupervised inductive identification of frames based upon the content of articles. Three groups of core approaches underlie a wide range of work in this area, and we compare three techniques based on these approaches against each other and against manual human analysts. The three techniques are a k-means clustering algorithm together with a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP)-based feature selection process; evolutionary factor analysis (EFA), a factor analysis approach; and the structural topic model (STM). We use two datasets - one very focused and one extremely broad - as examples of the kind of frame analysis problems readers may wish to attempt. Even in a highly targeted dataset, we find some distance between the frames generated by computational analysis and those manually produced by our human analysts. The details of each method have a substantial impact on frame quality and interpretation. We find that the STM approach is the most effective for our narrow-scope dataset, but that it returns definite topics, and not frames, when working on our very broad dataset. We also show that we can get results emphasizing different parts of the framing problem by combining parts of different methods as a multi-stage process, rather than viewing available methods as simple plug-and-play models.","[Nicholls, Tom] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Acad Affairs, Oxford, England; [Culpepper, Pepper D.] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Govt & Publ Policy, Oxford, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Nicholls, T (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford OX2 6GG, England.",tom.nicholls@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,"Culpepper, Pepper/0000-0001-6227-0813; Nicholls, Tom/0000-0002-6971-8614",European Research Council (ERC) under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [787887],This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 787887).

Multidisciplinary code studies reframed this technological perspective by positing code as the latest form of writing, where code's meaning is always partial and dependent on situational factors. Building out from this premise, this article theorizes coding as a form of writing with data through a qualitative case study of a web developer's coding on a data-journalism team. I specifically theorize code as a form of intermediary writing to examine how his coding to process and analyze data sets involved the construction and negotiation of emergent problems throughout his coding tasks. Findings suggest how he integrated previous coding experience with an emerging sense of how code helped him write and revise the data. I conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss how writing and code studies could develop mutually informative approaches to coding as a situated and relational writing activity.","[Lindgren, Chris Aaron] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Lindgren, CA (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept English, 207 Shanks Hall,181 Turner St NW, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",lindgren@vt.edu,"Lindgren, Chris/AAE-2554-2022",,University of Minnesota's Graduate Research Partners Program Fellowship from the College of Liberal Arts; Affiliates 21st Century Summer Research Fellowship in Professional and Technical Communication; James L.

Considering the name-calling and obscene and abusive phrases as communication practice, we rely on computational linguistics to investigate incivility in comments posted on online news stories and news portals' social media sites across time, platforms, and topics. The results of the dictionary-based quantitative content analysis show that incivility's frequency is steady in the examined three-year period. The topic and platform make the real difference: Politics attract more uncivil comments than business news, and less incivility is detected on Facebook than on the news sites. Contrary to popular perceptions, we find that incivility has not become significantly intensive in election campaign periods. Incivility, however, correlates to the dynamics of interaction. The comment-level analysis suggests that uncivil messages are likely to be surrounded by the same communication feature.","[Szabo, Gabriella; Kmetty, Zoltan] Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary; [Kmetty, Zoltan; Molnar, Emese K.] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Centre for Social Sciences; Eotvos Lorand University,"Szabo, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Social Sci, Budapest, Hungary.",szabo.gabriell@tk.hu; kmetty.zoltan@tatk.elte.hu; emesekmolnar@gmail.com,,,"NKFIHNational Research, Development & Innovation Office (NRDIO) - Hungary [FK-131990, NKFIH FK-128981]",The author's activity is funded under the Grant Agreement No. NKFIH FK-131990.

To explore the effect of an algorithmic vs. human source on hostile media perceptions, this study conducts a 3 (author attribution: human, algorithm, or human-assisted algorithm) x 3 (news attitude: pro-issue, neutral, or anti-issue) mixed factorial design online experiment (N = 511). This study uses a transformer-based adversarial network to auto-generate comparable news headlines. The framework was trained with a dataset of 364,986 news stories from 22 mainstream media outlets. The results show that the relative hostile media effect occurs when people read news headlines attributed to all types of authors. News attributed to a sole human source is perceived as more credible than news attributed to two algorithm-related sources. For anti-Trump news headlines, there exists an interaction effect between author attribution and issue partisanship while controlling for people's prior belief in machine heuristics. The difference of hostile media perceptions between the two partisan groups was relatively larger in anti-Trump news headlines compared with pro-Trump news headlines.","[Jia, Chenyan] Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Liu, Ruibo] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Dartmouth College,"Jia, CY (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",chenyanjia@utexas.edu; ruibo.liu.gr@dartmouth.edu,,,,,,59,1,1,5,5,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2021,9,4,,,,,170,181,,10.17645/mac.v9i4.4164,,,12,Communication,,Communication,XB1UT,WOS:000721120200006,,"gold, Green Published",,,44661,

It discusses propaganda as a tangible expression of ideology in communication-its principal purpose to enforce ideological goals, manage opinion, and consolidate loyalties. Starting from the notion of propaganda as a technique to further ideological interests that naturally hail from it, propaganda is discussed in relation to communication and information and how it relates to ideology and power, referring to ideas from key authors including Marx, Althusser, Gramsci, and Lukes. Taking inspiration from Gramsci, it discusses the role in propaganda communication of intellectuals, operating at the behest of elite power, but increasingly for the intellectuals' own interests.

The degree to which sponsored content predicted significant changes in corporate news coverage was investigated for elite media and U.S. online media. Corporate-sponsored content appeared to mildly suppress coverage of that corporation in online news. This effect, known as agenda cutting, happened both inside elite media and across the media landscape. Conversely, agenda building, or instances where sponsored content resulted in more media coverage, was very rare. We suggest that content studios, the departments of news media organizations that create sponsored content, may be exhibiting an agenda-setting effect more akin to traditional advertising departments, which have been known to suppress critical coverage of corporations that pay for ads.","[Vargo, Christopher Joseph] Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Amazeen, Michelle A.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; Boston University,"Vargo, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",christopherjvargo@gmail.com; mamazeen@bu.edu,,,,,,48,0,0,1,1,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

Descriptive results show that progovernment and opposition partisans report very different expectations of health and job risks. Job and health policy have become wedge issues that elicit partisan responses. The analysis exploits random variation in the survey recruitment to show the effects of the president's first speech on national television on the perceived risk and the moderating effect of partisanship.

By drawing upon a multidimensional framing analysis, this study investigated how personal action frames, collective action frames, and issue-specific frames were adopted in #MeToo movement in China, and it also shed light on how different groups of social actors respond to sexual harassment issues on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. This study employed computational content analysis to extract frames from a huge amount of traceable data (i.e., 16,187 Weibo posts) and uncovered seven specific types of frames categorized aspersonal experiencesandemotional commentary(as personal action frames),injusticeandopposition(as collective action frames), andproblem definition,treatment recommendation, andrelated news(as issue-specific frames). The results revealed that personal action frames and collective action frames were widely adopted by females and ordinary users, whereas issue-specific frames were more commonly applied by males and organizational users.

We investigate the differences in the legal prosecution of the political opposition, namely of members of the Communist, Social Democratic and National Socialist parties based on Vienna as a case study. Based on over 1,800 court records from 1935 processed at the Viennese provincial courts, we evaluate the courts' practice in contrast to the official legislature during the consolidated phase of the regime. In this study, we examine whether the law was strategically utilized against specific groups (following the concept of Kirchheimer (1965)'s political lawsuit), and as in the more lenient version of Fraenkel (1927/1968)'s tendency justice, we analyze whether the law was disadvantageously interpreted for political partisanship up to a blatant breach of conduct. Combining quantitative and qualitative methods with network science approaches, we identify patterns of political prosecution and structural predispositions for the sentencing of left-and right-wing groups of the political opposition. We can prove different practices of political judiciary and differentiate between the different treatment of Social Democrats, Communists and National Socialists in 1935 in Vienna. We identify specialized strategies to prosecute the political opposition, resulting in a clear bias against left-wing groups and a relative leniency in the conviction of National Socialists based on the evolution of charges in the courts' actions. Using a multimodal network approach, we reveal key players and cooperation of judges and prosecutors which accounted for harsher sentences. We provide evidence that the system of control over the judiciary and over the political opposition was already crumbling in the Austrian capital in 1935, even before the Anschluss to NS-Germany in 1938.","[Petz, Cindarella; Pfeffer, Juergen] Tech Univ Munich, Bavarian Sch Publ Policy, Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Petz, C (通讯作者)，Richard Wagner Str 1, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",cindarella.petz@tum.de,,,,,,68,0,0,2,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-8733,1879-2111,,SOC NETWORKS,Soc.

Through network analysis and topic modeling of 20,499 YouTube videos, we are able to show a clear distinction between Portuguese-language and English-language YouTube recommendations in regard to this topic. The most prominent videos of both communities feature mostly accurate and correct information about Zika, but both communities are prone to faulty and potentially dangerous misinformation. We show that this harmful misinformation is not separate from the communities that feature correct information.

Using computational textual analysis (topic modeling), we reveal how Womad's espousal of biological essentialism is inextricable from a neoliberalist belief in individual capacity. That is, neoliberalism allows the community to reconceive feminism as a means to advance individual cis-women's power over other identities. Womad's communal rhetoric is thus closely linked to its users' enthusiasm for neoliberal self-fashioning as the means to overcome female oppression, an optimism simultaneously complicated by the desire to escape Korea and the latter's patriarchal nationalism. In sum, Womad's vision of female emancipation-problematic as it is-needs to be situated alongside both its criticism of South Korean nationalism and its faith in neoliberalism as a means to escape the patriarchy.","[Koo, Jihae] Kookmin Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Minchul] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kookmin University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, M (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",kooji@kookmin.ac.kr; kimminc731@gmail.com,,,,,,58,0,0,2,3,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

In this article, we investigate the formats and modes of visual content deployed by Twitter users over a two-week period leading up to the 2019 EU Parliamentary elections and across two publics: those discussing the election at large and those discussing the more contentious issue of EU membership. Conducting a multilingual, cross-comparative content and thematic analysis of a sample of 1,097 images, we find that: (1) Visuals originating from traditional political actors prevailed among both Twitter discourses; (2) users shared substantial amounts of anti-EU, populist and, to a lesser extent, extremist images, though this content remained largely disjointed from the mainstream public debate; and (3) political humor emerged as a vector for anti-establishment and Eurosceptic themes, especially in discussions critical of the European project.

This article discusses two controversial cases surrounding algorithmic transparency in the South Korean digital environment. It first epitomizes the notion of algorithmic transparency as a prerequisite for accountability. Then, it situates the use of algorithms for online content curation in the South Korean digital environment to illustrate how algorithmic transparency is complicated by sociopolitical conditions.

In addition, the authors aim to conceptualize the roles of different users and provide insights for using microblogging platforms to disseminate information in this context. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an analysis on Sina Weibo microblogs about the African Swine Fever epidemic from August to October 2018. The authors firstly applied a label propagation algorithm to classify users into government, media, verified users and nonverified users. The authors analyzed several user metrics, traced the information propagation patterns of their microblogs and calculated the average speed of information propagation using computational approaches. Findings The authors' findings show that different types of users played different roles, such as supplying information, amplifying information, relaying information and engaging with other users. The microblogs posted by media dominated the propagation in most cases, but general users can propagate information faster. The direction of information propagation is one-way for the majority of microblogs, and few users repost earlier information. Additionally, microblogs attract more attention at the beginning and the middle phases of an epidemic. In the context of managing epidemics, the authors recommend governments and other verified users can work together to use microblogging platforms efficiently. Originality/value This research is one of the few studies to investigate information propagation patterns of different user categories on a Chinese microblogging platform during an epidemic. The authors' work can be used by government agencies and public health authorities for disseminating information efficiently during epidemics or emergencies, especially in the early stages.","[Sun, Li; Si, Yain-Whar] Univ Macau, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Macau, Peoples R China; [Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao] Victoria Univ, Victoria Univ Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Macau; Victoria University,"Pang, PCI (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Victoria Univ Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",mail@patrickpang.net,"Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao/B-2515-2016","Pang, Patrick Cheong-Iao/0000-0002-8820-5443",Research Committee of University of Macau [MYRG201800246-FST]; University of Macau,"This research was funded by the Research Committee of University of Macau, under grant MYRG201800246-FST.

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation(5-7). Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy(8,9), and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.","[Pennycook, Gordon] Univ Regina, Hill Levene Sch Business, Regina, SK, Canada; [Epstein, Ziv] MIT, Media Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Epstein, Ziv; Mosleh, Mohsen; Arechar, Antonio A.; Eckles, Dean; Rand, David G.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Mosleh, Mohsen] Univ Exeter, Dept SITE Sci Innovat Technol & Entrepreneurship, Business Sch, Exeter, Devon, England; [Arechar, Antonio A.] Ctr Res & Teaching Econ CIDE, Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes, Mexico; [Eckles, Dean; Rand, David G.] MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rand, David G.] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pennycook, Gordon] Univ Regina, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada",University of Regina; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Exeter; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Regina,"Pennycook, G (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Hill Levene Sch Business, Regina, SK, Canada.; Rand, DG (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Rand, DG (通讯作者)，MIT, Inst Data Syst & Soc, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Rand, DG (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.; Pennycook, G (通讯作者)，Univ Regina, Dept Psychol, Regina, SK, Canada.",gordon.pennycook@uregina.ca; drand@mit.edu,"; Mosleh, Mohsen/J-1218-2018","Eckles, Dean/0000-0001-8439-442X; Pennycook, Gordon/0000-0003-1344-6143; Rand, David/0000-0001-8975-2783; Mosleh, Mohsen/0000-0001-7313-5035",Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Initiative of the Miami Foundation; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Omidyar Network; John Templeton Foundation [61061]; Canadian Institutes of Health ResearchCanadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),"We acknowledge feedback and comments from A.

This finding contributes to the growing body of knowledge regarding his controversial online efforts, adding to the urgent research agenda on Brazil's democratic setback.","[Santini, Rose Marie; Salles, Debora; Tucci, Giulia] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Santini, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",marie.santini@eco.ufrj.br; debora.g.salles@gmail.com; giuliatucci@gmail.com,,"Tucci, Giulia/0000-0002-1829-2967",,,,77,0,0,3,5,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

This development is based on the assumption that digital traces left on social media can provide insights into the nature of human interaction. In this research, we turn our attention to what remains invisible in research based on social media data. Using Andrea Brighenti's work on social visibility as a point of departure, we unpack data invisibilities, as they are created within four dimensions: people and intentionality, technologies and tools, accessibility and form, and meaning and imaginaries. We introduce the notion of quasi-visible data as an intermediary between visible and invisible data highlighting the processual character of data invisibilities. With this conceptual framework, we contribute to developing a more reflective and ethical field of research into the study of social phenomena based on social media data. We conclude by arguing that distancing ourselves from the assumption that all social media data are visible and focusing on the invisible will enhance our understanding of digital data.","[Neumayer, Christina] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Commun, Media Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rossi, Luca] IT Univ Copenhagen, Dept Digital Design, Digital Media & Networks, Copenhagen, Denmark",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Copenhagen; IT University Copenhagen,"Neumayer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Humanities, Dept Commun, Karen Blixens Plads 8, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",christina.neumayer@hum.ku.dk,,"Neumayer, Christina/0000-0003-0450-2983",Velux FoundationVelux Fonden [12823]; Data as Relation: Governance in the Age of Big Data,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Velux Foundation [grant number 12823], Data as Relation: Governance in the Age of Big Data.",,63,2,2,10,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

The cognitive and computational mechanisms supporting this communication remain to be understood, however. Prosodic cues vary across talkers and speaking conditions, creating ambiguity in the sound-to-meaning mapping. We hypothesize that listeners ameliorate this ambiguity in part by learning talker-specific statistics of prosodic cues. To test this hypothesis, we investigate the production and recognition of question vs. statement prosody in American English. Experiment 1 elicits productions of questions and statements from 65 talkers to examine the distributional statistics characterizing within- and cross-talker variability in these productions. We use Bayesian ideal observer models to assess the predicted consequences of cross-talker variability on listeners? recognition of prosody. We find that learning of talker-specific distributional statistics is predicted to facilitate recognition, above and beyond what can be achieved via commonly assumed normalizations of prosodic cues. Experiment 2 tests this prediction in a comprehension experiment. We expose different groups of listeners to different prosodic input statistics and assess listeners? recognition of questions and statements both prior to, and following, exposure. Prior to exposure, ideal observer-derived predictions based on Experiment 1 provide a good qualitative fit against listeners? recognition of prosodic contours in Experiment 2. Following exposure, listeners shift the categorization boundary between questions and statements in ways consistent with learning of talker-specific statistics.","[Xie, Xin; Kurumada, Chigusa] Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Meliora Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Buxo-Lugo, Andres] Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Bldg,4094 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Rochester; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Xie, X (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, Meliora Hall, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.; Buxo-Lugo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Psychol, Biol Psychol Bldg,4094 Campus Dr, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",xxie13@ur.rochester.edu; buxolugo@umd.edu,,,University of Rochester,"The work presented here was partially supported by institutional research funds (University of Rochester) to CK.

In this exploratory study, via a machine learning software and with data visualization methods, we analyzed social media data in order to find patterns that can contribute to comprehend the new dynamics of influence between the media, politicians, and citizenship in the context of social media and digital communication, specifically on Twitter. We analyzed who the top 50 Spanish generalist media with most followers started following in 2017, 2018, and 2019 on Twitter, the quintessential informational network. To do so, we melded data visualization computational and manual methods. We used an artificial intelligence big data analysis software to visualize the network of media from Spain in order to identify the sample. Afterward, we extracted the top followed accounts by the sample and categorized them in types of accounts, institution/citizenship, country, number of followers, and gender, to proceed with the data visualization to identify trends and patterns. The results show that these media accounts started following mainly accounts that belonged to male politicians from Spain. We could also spot among the years of the study an inversely proportional trend from the media that went from following mainly institutions to following a majority of citizens, and to start following more accounts with a smaller number of followers every year. The tendency to follow accounts from Spain that belong to men grew or remained a majority among the years of the study.","[Israel-Turim, Veronica; Mico-Sanz, Josep Lluis; Ordeix-Rigo, Enric] Ramon Llull Univ, Pca Joan Coromines S-N, Barcelona 08001, Spain",Universitat Ramon Llull,"Ordeix-Rigo, E (通讯作者)，Ramon Llull Univ, Pca Joan Coromines S-N, Barcelona 08001, Spain.",enricor@blanquerna.url.edu,"Micó, Josep-Lluis/B-1201-2009","Micó, Josep-Lluis/0000-0003-1191-226X","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and CompetitivenessSpanish Government","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors have received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness, for this research as part of the project Influencers in Political Communication in Spain.

As the response to COVID-19 has reduced face-to-face contact, communication via social media has increased. Evidence shows that social media affects disease (non-)prevention through the (im)proper distribution of information, and distorts the predictive accuracy of infection models, including legacy Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models. Our adjusted SEIR model reflects the effectiveness of information disseminated through social media by accounting for dimensions of social/informational motivation based on social learning/use and gratification theories, and uses Monte Carlo methodology and computational algorithms to predict effects of social media on the spread of COVID-19 (N = 2,095 cases). The results suggest that social media utilisation measures should be incorporated into SEIR models to improve forecasts of COVID-19 infections. Utilising IS to analyse the spread of digital information via social media platforms can inform efforts to combat the pandemic and infodemic. Agencies responsible for infection and disease control, policy makers, businesses, institutions and educators must accurately monitor infection rates to appropriately allocate funding and human resources and develop effective disease prevention marketing campaigns.","[Bae, Sujin; Kwon, Ohbyung] Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea; [Sung, Eunyoung (Christine)] Montana State Univ Bozeman, Jake Jabs Coll Business & Entrepreneurship, Bozeman, MT USA",Kyung Hee University; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Kwon, O (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Sch Management, Seoul, South Korea.",obkwon@khu.ac.kr,,,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A3A2A02093277],This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2020S1A3A2A02093277].,,82,3,3,20,50,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-085X,1476-9344,,EUR J INFORM SYST,Eur.

There exist two control variables sigma(i) and two tensity rates mu(i) (i = 1; 2) after the transformation that should be solved for. Yuan and Li (Computational Economics, 2018) give a numerical algorithm by the first-order necessary condition, which overcomes several drawbacks of the normal algorithm and describe several numerical experiments demonstrating the performance of their method. However, their method exhibits at least one shortcoming, which is that the final value of the control variables sigma(i) (i = 1; 2) may exceed the definition domain. This situation means that the sigma(i) (i = 1; 2) is infeasible and unacceptable. This paper presents a new technique to avoid that situation, and an optimization pseudo-algorithm is designed using the following steps: (i) starting from the given initial points (sigma(0)(i), mu(0)(i)); an active-set algorithm is proposed; (ii) the limited memory update technique is used in the algorithm to obtain fast convergence and low storage; (iii) global convergence is established under suitable conditions; and (iv) numerical results are reported to demonstrate that the new algorithm is competitive with the normal algorithm.","[Li, Peng; Li, Xiangrong] Guangxi Univ, Business Sch, Nanning, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiangrong; Yuan, Gonglin] Guangxi Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Maojun] Suzhou Univ Sci & Technolog, Sch Business, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Guangxi University; Guangxi University,"Li, XR; Yuan, GL (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Coll Math & Informat Sci, Nanning, Guangxi, Peoples R China.; Zhang, MJ (通讯作者)，Suzhou Univ Sci & Technolog, Sch Business, Suzhou, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xrli68@163.com; glyuan@gxu.edu.cn; 2721@mail.usts.edu.cn,,,"Guangxi Natural Science Key Fund [2017GXNSFDA198046]; National Social Science Key Foundation of China [17AJL012]; Special Funds for Local Science and Technology Development Guided by the Central Government [ZY20198003]; Guangxi Science Fund for Distinguished Young ScholarsNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [2015GXNSFGA139001]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11661009, 71961004, 72061007]; High Level Innovation Teams and Excellent Scholars Program in Guangxi institutions of higher education [[2019] 52]","This work was supported by the the Guangxi Natural Science Key Fund [2017GXNSFDA198046]; the National Social Science Key Foundation of China [17AJL012]; the Special Funds for Local Science and Technology Development Guided by the Central Government [ZY20198003]; the Guangxi Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [2015GXNSFGA139001]; the National Natural Science Foundation of China [11661009,71961004,72061007]; the High Level Innovation Teams and Excellent Scholars Program in Guangxi institutions of higher education ([2019] 52).",,19,0,0,2,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Besides, it is difficult for general users to create their own VR/AR applications and foster their creative ideas without advanced programming skills. This paper addresses these issues by proposing an interactive extended reality toolkit, named BlocklyXR. The objective of this research is to provide general users with a visual programming environment to build an extended reality application for digital storytelling. The contextual design was generated from real-world map data retrieved from Mapbox GL. ThreeJS was used for setting up, rendering 3D environments, and controlling animations. A block-based programming approach was adapted to let users design their own story. The capability of BlocklyXR was illustrated with a use case where users were able to replicate the existing PalmitoAR utilizing the block-based authoring toolkit with fewer efforts in programming. The technology acceptance model was used to evaluate the adoption and use of the interactive extended reality toolkit. The findings showed that visual design and task technology fit had significantly positive effects on user motivation factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness). In turn, perceived usefulness had statistically significant and positive effects on intention to use, while there was no significant impact of perceived ease of use on intention to use.

However, there is little publicly available data to support either the existing concerns or YouTube's claims of having addressed them. Drawing on the idea of platform observability, this article combines computational and qualitative methods to investigate the types of content that the algorithms underpinning YouTube's up next feature amplify over time, using three keyword search terms associated with sociocultural issues where concerns have been raised about YouTube's role: coronavirus, feminism, and beauty. Over six weeks, we collected the videos (and their metadata, including channel IDs) that were highly ranked in the search results for each keyword, as well as the highly ranked recommendations associated with the videos. We repeated this exercise for three steps in the recommendation chain and then examined patterns in the recommended videos (and the channels that uploaded the videos) for each query and their variation over time. We found evidence of YouTube's stated efforts to boost authoritative media outlets, but at the same time, misleading and controversial content continues to be recommended. We also found that while algorithmic recommendations offer diversity in videos over time, there are clear winners at the channel level that are given a visibility boost in YouTube's up next feature. However, these impacts are attenuated differently depending on the nature of the issue.","[Matamoros-Fernandez, Ariadna; Gray, Joanne E.; Bartolo, Louisa; Burgess, Jean; Suzor, Nicolas] Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Matamoros-Fernandez, Ariadna; Gray, Joanne E.; Bartolo, Louisa; Burgess, Jean] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Suzor, Nicolas] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Law, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Matamoros-Fernandez, A (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Matamoros-Fernandez, A (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Commun, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",ariadna.matamorosfernandez@qut.edu.au; joanne.e.gray@qut.edu.au; l.bartolo@qut.edu.au; jean.burgess@qut.edu.au; n.suzor@qut.edu.au,,"Gray, Joanne/0000-0001-5425-4979; Matamoros Fernandez, Ariadna/0000-0003-2149-3820",QUT Digital Media Research Centre; Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and SocietyAustralian Research Council,"The authors would like to thank Guangnan Zhu for his work in preparing the RankFlow files for our visualizations, and Bernhard Rieder for his useful comments on earlier versions of this article.

Using as a case study two online outlets of large national newspapers, it employs computational approaches to detect patterns in time- and content-based user interactions with news content based on clickstream data. The analysis of interactions detects several distinct timelines of news consumption and scrutinises how users switch between news topics during reading sessions. Using clustering analysis, the article then identifies several types of news readers (e.g. samplers, gourmets) and examines their news diets. The results point out the limited variation in topical composition of the news diets between different types of readers and the tendency of these diets to align with the news supply patterns (i.e. the average distribution of topics covered by the outlet).","[Makhortykh, Mykola] Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabr Str 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [de Vreese, Claes] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Inst Informat Law IVIR, Informat Law, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Helberger, Natali] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Polit Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Harambam, Jaron] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Inst Informat Law IVIR, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bountouridis, Dimitrios] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands",University of Bern; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology,"Makhortykh, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, Inst Commun & Media Studies, Fabr Str 8, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",makhortykhn@yahoo.com,"Makhortykh, Mykola/S-4127-2019; Harambam, Jaron/A-8527-2012","Makhortykh, Mykola/0000-0001-7143-5317; Harambam, Jaron/0000-0002-8286-7147; Helberger, Natali/0000-0003-1652-0580",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific ResearchNetherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) [400.17.605],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (grant 400.17.605).",,50,6,6,6,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,SEP,2021,23,9,,,,,2773,2800,1.4614E+15,10.1177/1461444820933221,,44013,28,Communication,,Communication,UU7KL,WOS:000546589200001,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,44661,

It also considers the role of epistemic belief-the individual trait that inherently determines one's ability to separate fact from falsehood. In an online survey, 380 participants were each exposed to three hotel reviews-some authentic, others fake. Perceived specificity was positively related to perceived review authenticity, whereas perceived exaggeration showed a negative association. Epistemic belief with respect to justification for knowing significantly moderated both the relationships.","[Banerjee, Snehasish] Univ York, York Management Sch, Freboys Lane, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Chua, Alton Y.

But there are not the only ones to be hit. The COVID-19 pandemic has also substantially altered mental health, with anxiety symptoms being one of the most frequently reported problems. Especially, the number of people reporting anxiety symptoms increased significantly during the first lockdown-phase compared to similar data collected before the pandemic. Yet, most of these studies relied on a unitary approach to anxiety, wherein its different constitutive features (i.e., symptoms) were tallied into one sum-score, thus ignoring any possibility of interactions between them. Therefore, in this study, we seek to map the associations between the core features of anxiety during the first weeks of the first Belgian COVID-19 lockdownphase (n = 2,829). To do so, we implemented, in a preregistered fashion, two distinct computational network approaches: a Gaussian graphical model and a Bayesian network modelling approach to estimate a directed acyclic graph. Despite their varying assumptions, constraints, and computational methods to determine nodes (i.e., the variables) and edges (i.e., the relations between them), both approaches pointed to excessive worrying as a node playing an especially influential role in the network system of the anxiety features. Altogether, our findings offer novel data-driven clues for the ongoing field's larger quest to examine, and eventually alleviate, the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.","[Heeren, Alexandre] Catholic Univ Louvain, Psychol Sci Res Inst, 10 Pl Cardinal Mercier, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Hanseeuw, Bernard] Catholic Univ Louvain, Inst Neurosci, Brussels, Belgium; [Hanseeuw, Bernard] Clin Univ St Luc, Dept Neurol, Brussels, Belgium; [Hanseeuw, Bernard] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Radiol, Gordon Ctr Med Imaging, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cougnon, Louise-Amelie] Catholic Univ Louvain, Media Innovat & Intelligibil Lab, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Cougnon, Louise-Amelie; Lits, Gregoire] Catholic Univ Louvain, Language & Commun Inst, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain; Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Universite Catholique Louvain; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Heeren, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, Psychol Sci Res Inst, 10 Pl Cardinal Mercier, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",alexandre.heeren@uclouvain.be,"Heeren, Alexandre/U-9748-2019","Heeren, Alexandre/0000-0003-0553-6149; Cougnon, Louise-Amelie/0000-0002-1209-7474","F.R.S.-FNRS Belgian Science FoundationFonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [1.C.059.18F]; Helaers Foundation for Medical Research; Belgian Fund for Scientific Research (F.R.S.-FNRS, Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Special Research Fund (FSR) of the Universite catholique de Louvain","Alexandre Heeren was supported by the F.R.S.-FNRS Belgian Science Foundation (Grant 1.C.059.18F) and the Helaers Foundation for Medical Research.

Often called universe 4.0, this is an economy based on data that dilutes, in an unprecedented fashion, the boundaries between the physical, biological and digital world in all spheres of society. In having to face up to the uncertainty, complexity and speed associated with this global challenge, organisations of all kinds will be impelled to rethink future skills, jobs and business models. We focus on how this uncertain situation affects public relations. We suggest that the resulting paradoxes and controversies become an opportunity to research and reflect on the past and present of our discipline and redirect attention to the processes, strategies, and tools of intervention required for improved contemporary and future effectiveness. This present study analyses universe 4.0 processes affecting both the practice and the social function of public relations and argues for close linkages with multidimensional strategic intelligences and disruptive technologies based on artificial intelligence. It also involves conducting exploratory qualitative research based on a bibliometric analysis of specialised literature; undertaking content analysis via computational linguistics techniques; and applying Delphi methodology to consider public relations in universe 4.0. Our findings suggest not only that strategic intelligence is under researched in our field, but that a more developed public relations intelligence capable of adapting to universe 4.0 needs to be a hybrid of existing public relations and contemporary strategic intelligence.","[Soriano, Alba Santa] Univ Alicante, Technol Transfer Off, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Valdes, Rosa Maria Torres] Univ Alicante, Dept Commun & Social Psychol, Alicante 03690, Spain",Universitat d'Alacant; Universitat d'Alacant,"Soriano, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Alicante, Technol Transfer Off, Alicante 03690, Spain.",alba.santa@ua.es; rosa.torres@ua.es,"Santa Soriano, Alba/R-8144-2016","Santa Soriano, Alba/0000-0002-9853-8882",,,,133,0,0,3,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.","[Hu, Lingshu] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 246 Walter Williams Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Kearney, Michael Wayne] Univ Missouri, Columbia, MO USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Hu, LS (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, 246 Walter Williams Hall, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",lhu@mail.missouri.edu,"Hu, Lingshu/ABC-3421-2021","Hu, Lingshu/0000-0003-0304-882X",,,,72,3,3,7,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0261-927X,1552-6526,,J LANG SOC PSYCHOL,J.

It is an effortless way for people to enhance their communication, connect with like-minded people, and share ideas. Online social networks (OSNs) can be used for noble causes by bringing together communities with common shared interests and to promote awareness of various causes. However, there is a dark side to the use of OSNs. OSNs can also be used as a coordination and amplification platform for attacks. For instance, adversaries can increase the impact of an attack by causing panic in an area by promoting attacks using OSNs. Public data can help adversaries to determine the best timing for attacks, scheduling attacks, and then using OSNs to coordinate attacks on networks or physical locations. This convergence of the cyber and physical worlds is known as cybernetics. In this paper, we introduce an integrated method to identify malicious behavior and the actors responsible for propagating this behavior via online social networks. Throughout history we have used surveillance techniques to monitor negative behavior, activities, and information. Quantitative socio-technical methods such as deviant cyber flash mob (DCFM) detection and focal structure analysis (FSA) can provide reconnaissance capabilities that enable cities and governments to look beyond internal data and identify threats based on active events. Groups of powerful hackers can be identified through FSA which is an integrated model that uses a betweenness centrality method at the node-level and spectral modularity at group level to identify a hidden malicious and powerful focal structure (a subset of the network). Assessment of groups using DCFM methods can help to identify powerful actors and prevent attacks. In this study, we examine multiple data sets integrating the DCFM and FSA models to help cybersecurity experts see a better picture of the threat which will help to plan a better response.","[Alassad, Mustafa] Univ Arkansas, Dept Syst Engn, Coll Sci Technol Engn & Math C STEM, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA; [Spann, Billy; Agarwal, Nitin] Univ Arkansas, Dept Informat Sci, Coll Sci Technol Engn & Math C STEM, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Alassad, M (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Syst Engn, Coll Sci Technol Engn & Math C STEM, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.; Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Informat Sci, Coll Sci Technol Engn & Math C STEM, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.",mmalassad@ualr.edu; bxspann@ualr.edu; nxagarwal@ualr.edu,,,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1946391, OIA-1920920, IIS-1636933, ACI-1429160, IIS-1110868]; U.S. Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-10-1-0091, N00014-14-1-0489, N00014-15-P-1187, N00014-16-1-2016, N00014-16-1-2412, N00014-17-1-2675, N00014-17-1-2605, N68335-19-C-0359, N00014-19-1-2336, N68335-20-C-0540]; U.S. Air Force Research Lab, U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-17-S-0002, W911NF-16-1-0189]; U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W31P4Q-17-C-0059]; Arkansas Research Alliance; Jerry L.

It includes five layers based on Design Science Research, which are integrated with Natural Language Processing techniques (NLP), Computational Linguistics (CL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The approach is validated through a case study wherein the semantic values of a series of Twitter institutional accounts belonging to Colombian Universities are analyzed in terms of the 12 quality factors established by CNA. In addition, the topics and the sociolect used by different actors in the university communities are also analyzed. The current approach allows determining the sociolinguistic features of social groups in digital social networks.

In this paper, we argue that we must start to re-consider the hallmarks of cooperative communication and the core capabilities that we have developed for it, and which conversational agents need to be equipped with: incremental joint co-construction and mentalizing. We base our argument on a vast body of work on human-human communication and its psychological processes that we reason to be relevant and necessary to take into account when modeling human-agent communication.

An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. Objective: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. Methods: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). Results: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic.

They are also less likely to seek help because of self-stigma and entrenched stoic beliefs about help seeking as a sign of weakness. E-mental health services can span great distances to reach those in need and offer a degree of privacy and anonymity exceeding that of traditional face-to-face counseling and open up possibilities for identifying at-risk individuals for targeted intervention. Objective: This scoping review maps the research that has explored text-based e-mental health counseling services and studies that have used language use patterns to predict mental health status. In doing so, one of the aims was to determine whether text-based counseling services have the potential to circumvent the barriers faced by clients in rural and remote communities using technology and whether text-based communications, in particular, can be used to identify individuals at risk of psychological distress or self-harm. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive electronic literature search of PsycINFO, PubMed, ERIC, and Web of Science databases for articles published in English through November 2020. Results: Of the 9134 articles screened, 70 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that text-based, real-time communication with a qualified therapist is an effective form of e-mental health service delivery, particularly for individuals concerned with stigma and confidentiality. There is also converging evidence that text-based communications that have been analyzed using computational linguistic techniques can be used to accurately predict progress during treatment and identify individuals at risk of serious mental health conditions and suicide. Conclusions: This review reveals a clear need for intensified research into the extent to which text-based counseling (and predictive models using modern computational linguistics tools) may help deliver mental health treatments to underserved groups such as regional communities, identify at-risk individuals for targeted intervention, and predict progress during treatment. Such approaches have implications for policy development to improve intervention accessibility in at-risk and underserved populations.","[Dwyer, Anne; Estival, Dominique; Li, Weicong; Lam-Cassettari, Christa; Antoniou, Mark] Western Sydney Univ, MARCS Inst Brain Behav & Dev, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia; [de Almeida Neto, Abilio] NSW Govt, Ctr Work Hlth & Safety, Gosford, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Antoniou, M (通讯作者)，Western Sydney Univ, MARCS Inst Brain Behav & Dev, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",m.antoniou@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Estival, Dominique/0000-0002-6178-3825; Lam-Cassettari, Christa/0000-0001-6167-551X; Li, Weicong/0000-0002-7423-2846; Dwyer, Anne/0000-0003-4169-3096",NSW Government Centre for Work Health and Safety [SWNSW/654567/2019],All authors contributed to the authorship of this review.

Compared to other OSNs, it has a simple data model and a straightforward data access API. This makes it ideal for social network studies attempting to analyze the patterns of online behavior, the structure of the social graph, the sentiment towards various entities and the nature of malicious attacks in a vivid network with hundreds of millions of users. Indeed, Twitter has been established as a major research platform, utilized in more than ten thousands research articles over the last ten years. Although there are excellent review and comparison studies for most of the research that utilizes Twitter, there are limited efforts to map this research terrain as a whole. Here we present an effort to map the current research topics in Twitter focusing on three major areas: the structure and properties of the social graph, sentiment analysis and threats such as spam, bots, fake news and hate speech. We also present Twitter's basic data model and best practices for sampling and data access. This survey also lays the ground of computational techniques used in these areas such as Graph Sampling, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Along with existing reviews and comparison studies, we also discuss the key findings and the state of the art in these methods. Overall, we hope that this survey will help researchers create a clear conceptual model of Twitter and act as a guide to expand further the topics presented.","[Ioannidis, Sotiris] Tech Univ Crete, Univ Campus,EL 090034024, Khania 73100, Crete, Greece; [Antonakaki, Despoina; Fragopoulou, Paraskevi; Ioannidis, Sotiris] Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci ICS, N Plastira 100 Vassilika Vouton,EL 090101655, GR-70013 Iraklion, Crete, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Antonakaki, D (通讯作者)，Fdn Res & Technol Hellas FORTH, Inst Comp Sci ICS, N Plastira 100 Vassilika Vouton,EL 090101655, GR-70013 Iraklion, Crete, Greece.",despoina@ics.forth.gr; fragopou@ics.forth.gr; sotiris@ics.forth.gr,,,"European project CONCORDIA (EUROPEAN COMMISSION DirectorateGeneral Communications Networks, Content and Technology) [830927]","This work has been supported by the European project CONCORDIA, with grant number 830927 (EUROPEAN COMMISSION DirectorateGeneral Communications Networks, Content and Technology).

Different from recent studies on the promotion of sustainable operation by identifying the internal and external motivations of user participation, this paper aims to analyze the mechanism regarding how different motivations affect the decision of user participation from group-level perspective. To better understand the mechanism, internal and external motivations are, respectively, captured by return-cost analysis and user interactive network. Afterwards, a network evolutionary game model was formulated to analyze the dynamic strategy selection (e.g., active participation and passive participation) of all users. In addition, the stable equilibrium and evolutionary path of strategies are analyzed through computational experiments. Results indicate the following: (a) Rewards have an influence on the promotion of active participation. However, with the continued growth of rewards, this promotion does not make sense sustainably. (b) The promotional effect of information noise on the selection of active participation can be found when passive participation is the dominant strategy. However, the inhibitory effect can be seen in populations that mainly adopt active participation. (c) The scale-free feature of user interactive network inhibits the selection of active participation when active participation is the dominant strategy in populations. Results found here is beneficial for managers to implement the specified policies and thus to achieve the sustainability of co-creation community.","[Zhang, Fanshun; Li, Congdong] Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China; [Cao, Cejun] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China",Jinan University; Chongqing Technology & Business University,"Li, CD (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510632, Peoples R China.; Cao, CJ (通讯作者)，Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China.",zfs17708494886@163.com; licd@jnu.edu.cn; caocejun0601@tju.edu.cn,,"Cao, Cejun/0000-0002-8888-0035","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71672074, 72072072, 71904021]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2019A1515010045]; 2018 Guangzhou Leading Innovation Team Program (China) [201909010006]; Social Science Planning Project in Chongqing [2019QNGL27]","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 71672074, 72072072, and 71904021), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province of China (No. 2019A1515010045), 2018 Guangzhou Leading Innovation Team Program (China) (Grant no. 201909010006) and Social Science Planning Project in Chongqing (Grant no. 2019QNGL27).",,43,0,0,10,19,WILEY-HINDAWI,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FL, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, WIT 5HE, ENGLAND",1076-2787,1099-0526,,COMPLEXITY,Complexity,44573,2021,2021,,,,,,,,6660568,10.1155/2021/6660568,,,24,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Multidisciplinary Sciences",,Mathematics; Science & Technology - Other Topics,QA2OU,WOS:000613288500002,,gold,,,44661,

It is associated with strong emotional responses of regret (when the obtained outcome is inferior to the counterfactual) and relief (vice versa). Counterfactual thinking may play a role in various cognitive phenomena in disordered gambling, such as the effects of near-misses. This study compared individuals with gambling disorder (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 25) on a behavioural economic choice task that entailed choosing between two gambles, designed to measure counterfactual thinking. Participants provided affect ratings following both the obtained and the non-obtained outcomes. Choices were analyzed using a computational model that derived parameters reflecting sensitivity to expected value, risk variance, and anticipated regret. In the computational choice model, the group with gambling disorder showed increased sensitivity to anticipated regret, reduced sensitivity to expected value, and increased preference for high risk-variance gambles. On the affect ratings, the group with gambling disorder displayed blunted emotional sensitivity to obtained and counterfactual outcomes. Effect sizes of the group differences were modest. Participants with gambling disorder show wide-ranging alterations in decision-making processes and emotional reactivity to choice outcomes. Altered sensitivity to anticipatory regret in gambling disorder may contribute to the development of gambling-related cognitive distortions, and the influences of gambling marketing.","[Wu, Yin] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Psychol, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yin] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Affect & Social Cognit Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Kennedy, Dawn; Goshko, Caylee-Britt; Clark, Luke] Univ British Columbia, Ctr Gambling Res UBC, Dept Psychol, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Kennedy, Dawn; Goshko, Caylee-Britt; Clark, Luke] Univ British Columbia, Djavad Mowafaghian Ctr Brain Hlth, Vancouver, BC, Canada",Shenzhen University; Shenzhen University; University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia,"Clark, L (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Psychol, 2136 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z4, Canada.",yinwu0407@gmail.com; dawnkennedy@psych.ubc.ca; cgos8950@gmail.com; luke.clark@psych.ubc.ca,,"Clark, Luke/0000-0003-1103-2422","Centre for Gambling Research at UBC; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [RGPIN-2017-04069]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872784, 31600923]","This study was supported by the core funding of the Centre for Gambling Research at UBC.

However, with the increase in computational power, connectivity, and the need to enable people to live in the home for longer though the use of technology, then smart home assistants that could detect human emotion will improve the communication between a user and the assistant enabling the assistant of offer more productive feedback. Thus, the aim of this work is to analyze emotional states in speech and propose a suitable method considering performance verses complexity for deployment in Consumer Electronics home products, and to present a practical live demonstration of the research. In this article, a comprehensive approach has been introduced for the human speech-based emotion analysis. The 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) has been implemented to learn and classify the emotions associated with human speech. The paper has been implemented on the standard datasets (emotion classification) Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) and Toronto Emotional Speech Set database (TESS) (Young and Old). The proposed approach gives 90.48%, 95.79% and 94.47% classification accuracies in the aforementioned datasets. We conclude that the 1-D CNN classification models used in speaker-independent experiments are highly effective in the automatic prediction of emotion and are ideal for deployment in smart home assistants to detect emotion.","[Chatterjee, Rajdeep; Mazumdar, Saptarshi; Halder, Rohit; Maitra, Tanmoy] Kalinga Inst Ind Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Bhubaneswar 751024, India; [Sherratt, R.

At this time, banks will face multiple risks such as policy, operation, market and credit. The investigation on supply chain finance under information sharing from the aspect of credit risk assessment will be conducted. The genetic algorithm combined with support vector machine and BP neural network is selected to evaluate the credit risk of supply chain finance. In the support vector machine method, the parameter selection method adopts genetic algorithm. In the included data, the gap in growth capacity of SMEs is relatively large. The standard deviations of main business, net profit and total assets are all above 30%, and the standard deviations of current ratio and quick ratio are small, which means that the two are more stable and healthier. In addition, among all the investigated enterprises, the cost gap is large, and the standard deviation of the inventory decline price reserve is small, which means that most enterprises have good inventory quality. After classification, 32 high-quality enterprises, 46 neutral enterprises and 55 risk enterprises are obtained in the total sample. In the test sample, there are 21 high-quality enterprises, 12 neutral enterprises, and 26 risk enterprises. The overall classification accuracy of the support vector machine method optimized by genetic algorithm is relatively lower than that of the BP neural network method. The classification accuracy of the support vector machine method optimized by genetic algorithm is 76.27%, and the classification accuracy of BP neural network method is 89.83%. The supply chain financial risk assessment of SMEs is mainly explored from the perspective of banks. The results can provide theoretical support for reducing the probability of bank's profit damage and increasing the bank's profitability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Designing optimal community responses (social distancing, vaccination) is dependent on the stage of the disease progression, discovery of asymptomatic individuals, changes in virulence of the pathogen, and current levels of herd immunity. Community strategies may have severe and undesirable social and economic side effects. Modeling is the only available scientific approach to develop effective strategies that can minimize these unwanted side effects while retaining the effectiveness of the interventions. Methods: We extended the agent-based model, SpatioTemporal Human Activity Model (STHAM), for simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics. Results: Here we present preliminary STHAM simulation results that reproduce the overall trends observed in the Wasatch Front (Utah, United States of America) for the general population. The results presented here clearly indicate that human activity patterns are important in predicting the rate of infection for different demographic groups in the population. Conclusions: Future work in pandemic simulations should use empirical human activity data for agent-based techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

The use of stigmatizing language for the purpose of blaming sparked a debate. Objective: This study aims to identify social stigma and negative sentiment toward the blameworthy agents in social communities. Methods: We enabled a tailored text-mining platform to identify data in their natural settings by retrieving and filtering online sources, and constructed vocabularies and learning word representations from natural language processing for deductive analysis along with the research theme. The data sources comprised of ten news websites, eleven discussion forums, one social network, and two principal media sharing networks in Taiwan. A synthesis of news and social networking analytics was present from December 30, 2019, to March 31, 2020. Results: We collated over 1.07 million Chinese texts. Almost two-thirds of the texts on COVID-19 came from news services (n=683,887, 63.68%), followed by Facebook (n=297,823, 27.73%), discussion forums (n=62,119, 5.78%), and Instagram and YouTube (n=30,154, 2.81%). Our data showed that online news served as a hotbed for negativity and for driving emotional social posts. Online information regarding COVID-19 associated it with China-and a specific city within China through references to the Wuhan pneumonia-potentially encouraging xenophobia. The adoption of this problematic moniker had a high frequency, despite the World Health Organization guideline to avoid biased perceptions and ethnic discrimination. Social stigma is disclosed through negatively valenced responses, which are associated with the most blamed targets. Conclusions: Our sample is sufficiently representative of a community because it contains a broad range of mainstream online media. Stigmatizing language linked to the COVID-19 pandemic shows a lack of civic responsibility that encourages bias, hostility, and discrimination. Frequently used stigmatizing terms were deemed offensive, and they might have contributed to recent backlashes against China by directing blame and encouraging xenophobia. The implications ranging from health risk communication to stigma mitigation and xenophobia concerns amid the COVID-19 outbreak are emphasized.

Drawing on field theory, this explorative study evaluates the character of the professional community of editorial technologists by analyzing their discussions in the peer conference SRCCON over four years (2016-2019). Findings indicate that editorial technologists are united by the goal to improve journalism. They critically reflect on their roles and strive to augment their agency in the field through normalizing their computational skills, accumulating social capital, e.g., by building enduring relationships in newsrooms, and gaining symbolic capital. Instead of pressing to enforce technological adoption at all costs, editorial technologists acknowledge their responsibility towards the editorial office, news organizations, audiences, and society at large. These responsibilities form the core of their doxa, which is why we conceive of editorial technologists as a community of accountable engineers of sociotechnical change in journalism. Editorial technologists' collective professional imagination aims at overcoming the inert processes, hegemonic structures, and restrictive culture of journalism.","[Lischka, Juliane A.; Schaetz, Nadja; Oltersdorf, Anna-Lena] Univ Hamburg, Journalism & Commun Studies, Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Lischka, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Journalism & Commun Studies, Hamburg, Germany.",juliane.lischka@uni-hamburg.de,,"Schaetz, Nadja/0000-0001-6692-3471; Lischka, Juliane A./0000-0002-4845-0946",,,,48,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

First, we contend that CTAM development has prioritized technological over validity concerns, giving limited attention to the operationalization of social scientific measurements. Second, we identify a mismatch between CTAMs' focus on extracting specific contents and document-level patterns, and social science researchers' need for measuring multiple, often complex contents in the text. Third, we argue that the dominance of English language tools depresses comparative research and inclusivity toward scholarly communities examining languages other than English. We substantiate our claims by drawing upon a broad review of methodological work in the computational social sciences, as well as an inventory of leading research publications using quantitative textual analysis. Subsequently, we discuss implications of these three gaps for social scientists' uneven uptake of CTAM, as well as the field of computational social science text research as a whole. Finally, we propose a research agenda intended to bridge the identified gaps and improve the validity, utility, and inclusiveness of CTAM.","Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Mt Scopus, Jerusalem, Israel; Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; University College Dublin; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Baden, C (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem Mt Scopus, Dept Commun & Journalism, IL-9190501 Jerusalem, Israel.",c.baden@mail.huji.ac.il,"Baden, Christian/U-9165-2019","Baden, Christian/0000-0002-3771-3413; Schoonvelde, Martijn/0000-0003-4370-2654; van der Velden, Mariken/0000-0003-0227-9183",Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [951832],This work was supported by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme [951832].,,77,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

The analysis shows the dominance of political sources across countries and platforms, particularly in Latin America, demonstrating a strong role of the state in constructing pandemic news and suggesting that mainstream news organizations' social media posts maintain a strong elite orientation. Health sources were also prominent - consistent with the defining role of biomedical authority in health coverage-, while significant diversity of sources, including citizen sources, emerged as the pandemic went on. Our results also revealed that the use of specific sources significantly varied over time.

Much research in this field is founded on the premise that society is a complex system with emergent structures that can be modeled or reconstructed through digital data. This paper suggests that computational social science serves practical and legitimizing functions for digital capitalism in much the same way that neoclassical economics does for neoliberalism. In recognition of this homology, this paper develops a critique of the complexity perspective of computational social science and argues for a heterodox computational social science founded on the meta-theory of critical realism that is critical, methodological pluralist, interpretative and explanative. This implies diverting computational social science' computational methods and digital data so as to not be aimed at identifying invariant laws of social life, or optimizing state and corporate practices, but to instead be used as part of broader research strategies to identify contingent patterns, develop conjunctural explanations, and propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.","[Tornberg, Petter; Uitermark, Justus] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Postbus 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam,"Tornberg, P (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Postbus 15629, NL-1001 NC Amsterdam, Netherlands.",p.tornberg@uva.nl,,"Uitermark, Justus/0000-0002-5274-1455; Tornberg, Petter/0000-0001-8722-8646",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [732942],"The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant number 732942).",,127,2,2,12,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JUL,2021,8,2,,,,,,,2.05E+16,10.1177/20539517211047725,,,13,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,WC0PQ,WOS:000703966700001,,"gold, Green Published",,,2022/4/10,

Study of vocational and business education using the example of one of their journals,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ERZIEHUNGSWISSENSCHAFT,,,German,Article,,,,,,Science research; Scientific journals; Vocational and business education; Computational linguistics; Topic modeling,FIELD,"Scientific disciplines as communication and discourse communities of special experts deal not only with their subjects and their own methodology and methods, but also with themselves and the development of their paradigmatic foundations. This also has a broad tradition in educational science. The examination of discipline communication is particularly suitable for analyzing paradigmatic developments of cognitive and social dimension of science. In this context, the formal (written) communication that takes place in disciplinary journals is particularly interesting. However, qualitative analyzes are very time-consuming, especially when larger amounts of data and time periods are to be analyzed. In addition, there is the problem that a deductive, topic analysis needs disciplinary mapping approaches that operationalize the discipline objects relatively clearly. In contrast, quantitatively oriented computational linguistic analyzes allow inductive access to the topics published in journals and the processing of large amounts of data. In this article, a computer linguistic topic-modeling process is presented and applied, which inductively extracts the topics of an entire journal and gives each of its individual articles a quantitative topic weighting. This is done using the example of vocational and business education as an educational sub-discipline and Berufs- und Wirtschaftspadagogik-online as one of its central specialist journals. This has two main advantages as an application example. First, it is already available in digitized form. Second, it is suitable for validating the process and the identified topics, as its several issues are already topic-related. Our study shows that the investigated journal captures central research subjects of the scientific discipline. The procedure applied is also suitable for identifying methodical and methodological topics in the articles. Furthermore, as similarities and differences in thematic communication between people and organizations can be determined, the procedure also allows us to link the cognitive-content and social dimensions of paradigmatic progress. For example, we identified six groups of universities that work on similar topics.","[Jahn, Robert W.] Otto von Guericke Univ, Fak Humanwissensch, Zschokkestr 32, D-39104 Magdeburg, Germany; [Goldenstein, Jan] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Lehrstuhl Org Rihrung & Human Ressource Managemen, Wirtschaftswissenschaftl Fak, Carl Zeiss Str 3, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Goetzl, Mathias] Staat Studienseminar Lehrerausbildung Erfurt Lehr, Erfurt, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Jahn, RW (通讯作者)，Otto von Guericke Univ, Fak Humanwissensch, Zschokkestr 32, D-39104 Magdeburg, Germany.",robert.jahn@ovgu.de; jan.goldenstein@uni-jena.de; mathias.goetzl@netzwerk-bwp.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,64,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",1434-663X,1862-5215,,Z ERZIEHWISS,Z.

New computational methods allow for analysis of cross-platform use by tracking links to websites shared over Twitter, which, in turn, can uncover some of the content and dynamics of information sources and agenda-setting processes. Such understanding can advance theory and efforts to reduce misinformation. Objective: Informed by agenda-setting theory, this study aimed to identify the content and temporal patterns of websites shared in vaccine-related tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations on Twitter between February and June 2020. Methods: We used triangulation of data analysis methods. Data mining consisted of the screening of around 5 million tweets posted to COVID-19 conversations to identify tweets that related to vaccination and including links to websites shared within these tweets. We further analyzed the content the 20 most-shared external websites using a mixed methods approach. Results: Of 841,896 vaccination-related tweets identified, 185,994 (22.1%) contained links to specific websites. A wide range of websites were shared, with the 20 most-tweeted websites constituting 14.5% (27,060/185,994) of the shared websites and typically being shared for only 2 to 3 days. Traditional media constituted the majority of these 20 websites, along with other social media and governmental sources. We identified markers of inauthentic propagation for some of these links. Conclusions: The topic of vaccination was prevalent in tweets about COVID-19 early in the pandemic. Sharing websites was a common communication strategy, and its bursty pattern and inauthentic propagation strategies pose challenges for health promotion efforts. Future studies should consider cross-platform use in dissemination of health information and in counteracting misinformation.","[Cruickshank, Iain] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Computat Anal Social & Org Syst, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA; [Ginossar, Tamar] Univ New Mexico, Dept Commun & Journalism, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Sulskis, Jason; Zheleva, Elena; Berger-Wolf, Tanya] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Berger-Wolf, Tanya] Ohio State Univ, Translat Data Analyt Inst, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; University of New Mexico; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Ohio State University,"Cruickshank, I (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Ctr Computat Anal Social & Org Syst, 5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15201 USA.",icruicks@andrew.cmu.edu,,"Berger-Wolf, Tanya/0000-0001-7610-1412; ginossar, tamar/0000-0002-0136-6675; Cruickshank, Iain/0000-0002-4205-5806",Omar N Bradley Foundation through a General Omar N Bradley Research Fellowship in Mathematics Grant; University of New Mexico Women in STEM Faculty Development Fund,"This research was, in part, funded by the Omar N Bradley Foundation through a General Omar N Bradley Research Fellowship in Mathematics Grant (IC) and was conducted with support from the University of New Mexico Women in STEM Faculty Development Fund (TG).

However, to discern common patterns across news organisations, a comprehensive empirical investigation looking into the impacts of automated news on media practitioners is needed. To lay the ground for such an empirical work, this paper raises the necessary questions to be taken into consideration, while reflecting on the potential implications for journalism practice. To do so, we relied on key concepts developed in Bourdieu's Field theory to assess whether automated journalism is likely to change or reinforce the prevailing journalistic doxa, or the rules of the game within the journalistic field. This led us to conceive an analytical framework that builds on these concepts, first to come up with our own reflections on the modifications and reinforcements of the journalistic doxa, then to contribute a table of essential dimensions to consider for an empirical investigation that looks into the impacts of automated journalism on media practitioners.","[Danzon-Chambaud, Samuel; Cornia, Alessio] Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland",Dublin City University,"Danzon-Chambaud, S (通讯作者)，Dublin City Univ, Sch Commun, Dublin, Ireland.",samuel.danzonchambaud2@mail.dcu.ie,,"Danzon-Chambaud, Samuel/0000-0002-5123-9682; CORNIA, ALESSIO/0000-0002-5136-7553",European UnionEuropean Commission [765140],This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 765140.,,60,1,1,6,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

These computational insights have the potential to support clinician-patient communication during psychotherapy consultations. However, how clinicians perceive and envision using computational insights during consultations has been underexplored. Objective: The aim of this study is to understand clinician perspectives regarding computational mental health insights from patients' social media activities. We focus on the opportunities and challenges of using these insights during psychotherapy consultations. Methods: We developed a prototype that can analyze consented patients' Facebook data and visually represent these computational insights. We incorporated the insights into existing clinician-facing assessment tools, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Global Functioning: Social Scale. The design intent is that a clinician will verbally interview a patient (eg, How was your mood in the past week?) while they reviewed relevant insights from the patient's social media activities (eg, number of depression-indicative posts). Using the prototype, we conducted interviews (n=15) and 3 focus groups (n=13) with mental health clinicians: psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and licensed clinical social workers. The transcribed qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Clinicians reported that the prototype can support clinician-patient collaboration in agenda-setting, communicating symptoms, and navigating patients' verbal reports. They suggested potential use scenarios, such as reviewing the prototype before consultations and using the prototype when patients missed their consultations. They also speculated potential negative consequences: patients may feel like they are being monitored, which may yield negative effects, and the use of the prototype may increase the workload of clinicians, which is already difficult to manage. Finally, our participants expressed concerns regarding the prototype: they were unsure whether patients' social media accounts represented their actual behaviors; they wanted to learn how and when the machine learning algorithm can fail to meet their expectations of trust; and they were worried about situations where they could not properly respond to the insights, especially emergency situations outside of clinical settings. Conclusions: Our findings support the touted potential of computational mental health insights from patients' social media account data, especially in the context of psychotherapy consultations. However, sociotechnical issues, such as transparent algorithmic information and institutional support, should be addressed in future endeavors to design implementable and sustainable technology.","[Yoo, Dong Whi; Ernala, Sindhu Kiranmai; Saket, Bahador; Weir, Domino; Abowd, Gregory; De Choudhury, Munmun] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, 756 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA; [Arenare, Elizabeth; Ali, Asra F.; Van Meter, Anna R.; Birnbaum, Michael L.] Northwell Hlth, Zucker Hillside Hosp, Glen Oaks, NY USA; [Van Meter, Anna R.; Birnbaum, Michael L.] Feinstein Inst Med Res, Manhasset, NY USA; [Van Meter, Anna R.; Birnbaum, Michael L.] Donald & Barbara Zucker Sch Med Hofstra Northwell, Hempstead, NY USA; [Abowd, Gregory] Northeastern Univ, Coll Engn, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Northwell Health; Northwell Health; Northeastern University,"Yoo, DW (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, 756 W Peachtree St NW, Atlanta, GA 30308 USA.",yoo@gatech.edu,,"Saket, Bahador/0000-0002-5896-0149; Arenare, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0911-3207; Weir, Domino/0000-0001-5556-1081; Van Meter, Anna/0000-0003-0012-206X; Abowd, Gregory/0000-0002-3408-587X",National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R01MH117172],"The authors would like to thank Koustuv Saha, Vedant Das Swain, Qiaosi Wang, and the members of the Georgia Tech Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab and Georgia Tech Ubicomp Group for their valuable feedback.

Here we report results from a randomized longitudinal field experiment embedded in a nationally representative online panel survey (N = 1,037) in which participants were incentivized to change their browser default settings and social media following patterns, boosting the likelihood of encountering news with either a left-leaning (HuffPost) or right-leaning (Fox News) slant during the 2018 US midterm election campaign. Data on approximate to 19 million web visits by respondents indicate that resulting changes in news consumption persisted for at least 8 wk. Greater exposure to partisan news can cause immediate but short-lived increases in website visits and knowledge of recent events. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, however, we find little evidence of a direct impact on opinions or affect. Still, results from later survey waves suggest that both treatments produce a lasting and meaningful decrease in trust in the mainstream media up to 1 y later. Consistent with the minimal-effects tradition, direct consequences of online partisan media are limited, although our findings raise questions about the possibility of subtle, cumulative dynamics. The combination of experimentation and computational social science techniques illustrates a powerful approach for studying the long-term consequences of exposure to partisan news.","[Guess, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Guess, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Barbera, Pablo] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Munzert, Simon] Hertie Sch, Data Sci Lab, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Yang, JungHwan] Univ Illinois, Dept Commun, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; University of Southern California; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Guess, AM (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.; Guess, AM (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",aguess@princeton.edu,"Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848; Munzert, Simon/0000-0003-4760-367X; Yang, JungHwan/0000-0001-5807-0982",Volkswagen Foundation Computational Social Science Initiative [92 143]; Princeton University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences; Center for International Studies at the University of Southern California,"This research was generously funded by a grant from the Volkswagen Foundation Computational Social Science Initiative, reference 92 143.

Yet, people routinely produce redundant adjectives and their propensity to do so varies cross-linguistically. Here, we propose a computational theory, whereby speakers create referential expressions designed to facilitate listeners' reference resolution, as they process words in real time. We present a computational model of our account, the Incremental Collaborative Efficiency (ICE) model, which generates referential expressions by considering listeners' real-time incremental processing and reference identification. We apply the ICE framework to physical reference, showing that listeners construct expressions designed to minimize listeners' expected visual search effort during online language processing. Our model captures a number of known effects in the literature, including cross-linguistic differences in speakers' propensity to over-specify. Moreover, the ICE model predicts graded acceptability judgments with quantitative accuracy, systematically outperforming an alternative, brevity-based model. Our findings suggest that physical reference production is best understood as driven by a collaborative goal to help the listener identify the intended referent, rather than by an egocentric effort to minimize utterance length.","[Jara-Ettinger, Julian] Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Rubio-Fernandez, Paula] Univ Oslo, Dept Philosophy Class Hist Art & Ideas, Oslo, Norway; [Rubio-Fernandez, Paula] MIT, Dept Brain & Cognit Sci, E25-618, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Yale University; University of Oslo; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Jara-Ettinger, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Psychol, 2 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",julian.jara-ettinger@yale.edu,"Rubio-Fernandez, Paula/P-3574-2014","Rubio-Fernandez, Paula/0000-0003-1622-0967; Jara-Ettinger, Julian/0000-0002-6167-1647",,,,96,0,0,1,1,AMER PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0033-295X,1939-1471,,PSYCHOL REV,Psychol.

Drawing from 15 qualitative interviews with representatives of newsroom management from legacy news institutions in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States, the study analyses their (cl)aims to maintain the newsroom as a stable, but dynamic working environment and reveals three dualist propositions when negotiating automation novelties - human journalistic agency stands in contrast to technology, skills are separated from newsworkers, and the creation of news contrasts with its presentation. The results show the interviewees re-articulate the dominance of human agency over technology, re-establish technological innovations as liberating newsworkers rather than subordinating them, and standardise news by re-evaluating the concept as both a civic bond and a commodity. Such considerations are detached from recent concerns about automation of human labour and closer to what we call algorithmic sublime, maintaining the newsroom management's loyalty to both the professional values of journalism and the corporate goals of management.","[Milosavljevic, Marko; Vobic, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Dept Journalism, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Vobic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Kardeljeva Ploscad 5, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",igor.vobic@fdv.uni-lj.si,,"Vobic, Igor/0000-0001-7990-5985",,,,59,5,5,5,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,SEP,2021,22,9,,,,,2203,2221,,10.1177/1464884919861598,,,19,Communication,,Communication,UA0IQ,WOS:000684849600003,,Green Published,,,2022/4/10,

The key question can be phrased as follows: Is it possible to transform the notion of social pattern from its current status in sociology as a proto-concept into a fully worked out concept? And if so, how can this be done? To provide material for the discussion we begin by introducing a few different types of patterns that are currently being used (patterns in nature, cultural patterns, statistical patterns, and computationally generated patterns). This is followed by a suggestion for what a strictly sociological concept of social pattern may look like. A useful and theoretically solid concept of social pattern can in our view be constructed by basing it on Weber's concept of social action. This means that both the behavior of the actors and the meaning these invest their behavior with must be taken into account. The article ends with a brief discussion of how to use the concept of social patterns in an effective way and what may endanger such a use.","[Mondani, Hernan] Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mondani, Hernan] Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; [Swedberg, Richard] Cornell Univ, Dept Sociol, Uris Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Stockholm University; Cornell University,"Mondani, H (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Dept Sociol, Stockholm, Sweden.; Mondani, H (通讯作者)，Inst Futures Studies, Stockholm, Sweden.",hernan.mondani@sociology.su.se,"Mondani, Hernan/AAD-8412-2022","Mondani, Hernan/0000-0003-2685-9238","Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ) [M18-0214:1]; Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) [2016-486, 2019-13780]","HM would like to acknowledge financial support from the Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences (Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, RJ), grant registration number M18-0214:1, and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) grants number 2016-486 and 2019-13780.",,93,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0304-2421,1573-7853,,THEOR SOC,Theory Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11186-021-09463-z,,Oct-21,22,Sociology,,Sociology,WG3LV,WOS:000706898100001,,hybrid,,,2022/4/10,

This study attempts to determine the ways in which the mainstream digital news covers the etiology of obesity and diseases associated with the burden of obesity. Objective: The dual objectives of this study are to obtain an understanding of what the news reports on obesity and to explore meaning in data by extending the preconceived grounded theory. Methods: The 10 years of news text from 2010 to 2019 compared the development of obesity-related coverage and its potential impact on its perception in Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Digital news stories on obesity along with affliction and inferences in 9 Chinese mainstream newspapers were sampled. An automatic content analysis tool, DiVoMiner was proposed. This computer-aided platform is designed to organize and filter large sets of data on the basis of the patterns of word occurrence and term discovery. Another programming language, Python 3, was used to explore connections and patterns created by the Results: A total of 30,968 news stories were identified with increasing attention since 2016. The highest intensity of newspaper coverage of obesity communication was observed in Taiwan. Overall, a stronger focus on 2 shared causative attributes of obesity is on stress (n=4483, 33.0%) and tobacco use (n=3148, 23.2%). The burdens of obesity and cardiovascular diseases are implied to be the most, despite the aggregated interaction of edge centrality showing the highest link between the cancer and obesity. This study goes beyond traditional journalism studies by extending the framework of computational and customizable web-based text analysis. This could set a norm for researchers and practitioners who work on data projects largely for an innovative attempt. Conclusions: Similar to previous studies, the discourse between the obesity epidemic and personal afflictions is the most emphasized approach. Our study also indicates that the inclination of blaming personal attributes for health afflictions potentially limits social and governmental responsibility for addressing this issue.","[Chang, Angela; Jiao, Wen] Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, E21 FSS Bldg,2nd Fl, Taipa 100, Macao, Peoples R China; [Chang, Angela; Schulz, Peter Johannes] Univ Lugano, Inst Commun & Hlth, Lugano, Switzerland; [Liu, Matthew Tingchi] Univ Macau, Fac Business Adm, Taipa, Macao, Peoples R China",University of Macau; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; University of Macau,"Chang, A (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, E21 FSS Bldg,2nd Fl, Taipa 100, Macao, Peoples R China.",wychang@um.edu.mo,,"Liu, Matthew/0000-0002-1820-5691; Jiao, Wen/0000-0002-9270-0033; Schulz, Peter Johannes/0000-0003-4281-489X","University of Macau [MYRG2019-00079-FSS, MYRG2018-00062-FSS]","This study was funded by the University of Macau (MYRG2019-00079-FSS and MYRG2018-00062-FSS) .

Research showing increasing time and resource pressure on journalists has led to concerns about the demise of investigative reporting and the ability of today's journalists to interrogate information adequately. Some digital innovations (e.g. tools facilitating robot journalism) have been viewed with suspicion by newsrooms. This paper reports on a research project that seeks to create an innovative tool to support the creative capabilities of time and resource poor journalists. The INJECT project used the advanced information discovery capabilities of digitisation to help journalists find new angles on stories and this paper analyses the extent to which such initiatives might harness digital innovation to benefit both the quality and range of reporting and thereby enhance creativity. It examines the potential of an information processing model of creativity derived from the INJECT tool to assist and support journalists, exploring the theoretical impact as well as the practical implications reported from the newsroom.","[Franks, Suzanne] City Univ London, Journalism, London, England; [Wells, Rebecca] City Univ London, Sch Hlth Sci, London, England; [Maiden, Neil] City Univ London, Digital Creat Business Sch, London, England; [Zachos, Konstantinos] City Univ London, Sch Business, London, England",City University London; City University London; City University London; City University London,"Franks, S (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Journalism, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Suzanne.Franks.1@city.ac.uk,,"Franks, Suzanne/0000-0002-9449-2725",EUEuropean Commission [723328],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research reported in this paper was supported by the EU-funded H2020 723328 INJECT innovation action.",,63,0,0,2,3,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211010582,,Apr-21,19,Communication,,Communication,RS0CY,WOS:000643455900001,,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2022/4/10,

A computational research approach was used, cross-analyzing proxy measures of real-time affective fluctuation of viewers during the 2019 Super Bowl broadcast and their tweets regarding the ads aired during the Super Bowl. The results demonstrated significant impact of consumers' temporary affective states, induced by the performance of the team they cheer for, on their engagement with different types of ads, even when they were exposed to the same set of ads during commercial breaks. Specifically, consumers in the positive affective state showed greater tendency to be drawn to engage with high semantic-affinity ads than those in the negative affective state. Consumers in the negative affective state showed greater tendency to be drawn to engage with more positively valenced ads than those in the positive affective state. This study provides theoretical contributions regarding the role of consumers' affect in their engagement with ads and practical implications for ad targeting and ad placement strategies based on consumers' temporary affect.","[Lu, Xinyu] Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Das, Debarati; Huh, Jisu; Srivastava, Jaideep] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Shanghai International Studies University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Lu, XY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Int Studies Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, 550 Dalian Rd W, Shanghai 200083, Peoples R China.",xinyulu@shisu.edu.cn,,,"Ralph D.

Traditionally, such efforts included polling aggregates, economic indicators, partisan affiliation, and campaign effects to predict aggregate voting outcomes. With increasing secondary usage of online-generated data in social science, researchers have begun to consult metadata from widely used web-based platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Trends and Wikipedia to calibrate forecasting models. Web-based platforms offer the means for voters to retrieve detailed campaign-related information, and for researchers to study the popularity of campaigns and public sentiment surrounding them. However, past contributions have often overlooked the interaction between conventional election variables and information-seeking behaviour patterns. In this work, we aim to unify traditional and novel methodology by considering how information retrieval differs between incumbent and challenger campaigns, as well as the effect of perceived candidate viability and media coverage on Wikipedia's predictive ability. In order to test our hypotheses, we use election data from United States Congressional (Senate and House) elections between 2016 and 2018. We demonstrate that Wikipedia data, as a proxy for information-seeking behaviour patterns, is particularly useful for predicting the success of well-funded challengers who are relatively less prevalent in the media. In general, our findings underline the importance of a mixed-data approach to predictive analytics in computational social science.","[Salem, Hamza; Stephany, Fabian] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England; [Stephany, Fabian] Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany",University of Oxford,"Stephany, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England.; Stephany, F (通讯作者)，Humboldt Inst Internet & Soc, Berlin, Germany.",fabian.stephany@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,76,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In this article, we address both by describing computational and network methods that can be used to identify cases of rare phenomena. We evaluate each method's relative utility in the identification of a specific rare phenomenon of interest to social movement researchers: the spillover of social movement claims from one movement to another. We identify and test five different approaches to detecting cases of spillover in the largest data set of protest events currently available, finding that an ensemble approach that combines clique and correspondence analysis and an ensemble approach combining all methods perform considerably better than others. Our approach is preferable to other ways of analyzing such cases; compared to qualitative approaches, our computational process identifies many more cases of spillover-some of which are surprising and would likely not be otherwise investigated. At the same time, compared to crude quantitative measures, our approach substantially reduces the noise, or identification of false-positive cases, of movement spillover. We argue that this technique, which can be adapted to other research topics, is a good illustration of how the thoughtful implementation of computational methods can allow for the efficient identification of rare events and also bridge deductive and inductive approaches to scientific inquiry.","[Elliott, Thomas] GitHub, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA; [Ring-Ramirez, Misty] Austin Peay State Univ, Sociol, Clarksville, TN 37044 USA; [Earl, Jennifer] Univ Arizona, Sociol & Govt & Publ Policy Courtesy, Tucson, AZ USA",Austin Peay State University; University of Arizona,"Elliott, T (通讯作者)，GitHub, San Francisco, CA 94107 USA.",telliott@fastmail.com; ringramirezm@apsu.edu; jenniferearl@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,39,1,1,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

By covering extremists, media grant terrorists organizations access to a global audience. While they delegitimize their actions they also empower extremists' standing as influential actors in international conflicts. Extending research on terrorist attacks as events of political violence, this study analyzes media attention toward terrorist organizations as actors of political violence. Specifically, we focus on how news values connected to groups and their actions explain media attention. We use computational methods, specifically an automated content analysis of media coverage of 30 terrorist organizations in the US and the UK (N = 18,536). Results illustrate that terrorists can prompt media attention through newsworthy events, specifically by perpetrating lethal attacks on civil targets. The news value of continuity leads to follow-up coverage once a group has secured media attention, while other characteristics such as group ideology or governmental designations are not consistently associated with coverage. By highlighting the role of news values and the capitalization of such by terrorist organizations, the study critically reflects on journalism's role in covering extremists.","[Hellmueller, L.; Lindner, P.] Univ Houston, Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, Houston, TX USA; [Hase, V.] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Houston System; University of Houston; University of Zurich,"Hellmueller, L (通讯作者)，Jack J Valenti Sch Commun, 3347 Cullen Blvd, Houston, TX 77204 USA.",leahellmueller@uh.edu,"Hase, Valerie/AAF-3430-2019","Hase, Valerie/0000-0001-6656-4894; Lindner, Peggy/0000-0002-0447-5690; Hellmueller, Lea/0000-0002-6609-9395",Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [IZSEZ0_181703],This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under Grant Number IZSEZ0_181703.,,65,0,0,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1520-5436,1532-7825,,MASS COMMUN SOC,Mass Commun.

The analysis is based on an automated content analysis of all tweets (N = 137,771) sent out by the German police in 2019. It identifies different patterns regarding the usage of Twitter between police entities on different levels of governance and in differing types of environments and examines how these patterns translate into different levels of user engagement. We find that German police entities differ in their use of Twitter and that environmental and organizational aspects can explain these differences.

Moreover, the study presents results on differences in the depiction of male and female candidates across party lines. With the help of computational vision, we demonstrate that, while differences between progressive and conservative candidates are scarce, there are clear differences in the depiction of female and male politicians. These differences resemble emotional gender stereotypes, especially since women are more often depicted as happy.

The efficient identification of such influence-maximizing groups is an active area of research with diverse practical relevance. Greedy-based methods can provide solutions of reliable accuracy, but the computational cost of the required Monte Carlo simulations renders them infeasible for large networks. Meanwhile, although network structure-based centrality methods can be efficient, they typically achieve poor recognition accuracy. Here, we establish an effective influence assessment model based both on the total valuation and variance in valuation of neighbor nodes, motivated by the possibility of unreliable communication channels. We then develop a discrete moth-flame optimization method to search for influence-maximizing node sets, using a local crossover and mutation evolution scheme atop the canonical moth position updates. To accelerate convergence, a search area selection scheme derived from a degree-based heuristic is used. The experimental results on five real-world social networks, comparing our proposed method against several alternatives in the current literature, indicates our approach to be effective and robust in tackling the influence maximization problem.","[Wang, Lu; Ma, Lei; Xie, Neng-gang] Anhui Univ Technol, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Maanshan 243002, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chao] Anhui Polytech Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China; [Koh, Jin Ming; Cheong, Kang Hao] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Sci Math & Technol Cluster, Singapore 487372, Singapore; [Koh, Jin Ming] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Cheong, Kang Hao] SUTD Massachusetts Inst Technol, Int Design Ctr, Singapore 487372, Singapore",Anhui University of Technology; Anhui Polytechnic University; Singapore University of Technology & Design; California Institute of Technology,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Anhui Polytech Univ, Dept Architectural Engn, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China.; Cheong, KH (通讯作者)，Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Sci Math & Technol Cluster, Singapore 487372, Singapore.; Cheong, KH (通讯作者)，SUTD Massachusetts Inst Technol, Int Design Ctr, Singapore 487372, Singapore.",wang.chao.cn.ah@gmail.com; kanghao_cheong@sutd.edu.sg,"Wang, Chao/ABG-7763-2021; Wang, Chao/AFN-9784-2022","Wang, Chao/0000-0002-2226-9575; Cheong, Kang Hao/0000-0002-4475-5451","Scientific Research Foundation of Education Department of Anhui Province, China [KJ2019A0091, KJ2019ZD09]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [19YJAZH098]; Singapore University of Technology and Design Start-Up Research GrantSingapore University of Technology & Design [SRG SCI 2019 142]","This work was supported in part by the Scientific Research Foundation of Education Department of Anhui Province, China, under Grant KJ2019A0091 and Grant KJ2019ZD09; in part by the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education of China under Grant 19YJAZH098; and in part by the Singapore University of Technology and Design Start-Up Research Grant under Project SRG SCI 2019 142.

A computational content analysis was performed to identify the primary themes of users' communication on r/COVID19, while stepwise segmented regression was used to assess identify longitudinal changes in the volume of user contributions. Findings showed that while conversations were centered on scientific conversations, they were catalyzed by sociological and political developments rather than scientific breakthroughs. Future studies should examine the effects of pandemic-related communities on lurkers, the effects of visibility on scientific and medical contributions, and the implications of pseudonymity and ambiguous credentials in a community addressing a volatile health and scientific topic.","[Britt, Rebecca K.; Panek, Elliot; Lee, Jiyoung] Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Dept Journalism & Creat Media, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Britt, Brian C.] Univ Alabama, Coll Commun & Informat Sci, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Britt, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, 901 Univ Blvd,Reese Phifer Hall 484A, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",rkbritt@ua.edu,,"Britt, Brian/0000-0002-1521-3258; Panek, Elliot/0000-0002-9060-5913",Public Opinion Lab at the University of Alabama,"This research was supported by the Public Opinion Lab at the University of Alabama, which provided software support for data collection for this research project.",,41,0,0,2,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1041-0236,1532-7027,,HEALTH COMMUN,Health Commun.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10410236.2021.1994190,,Dec-21,11,Communication; Health Policy & Services,,Communication; Health Care Sciences & Services,XJ9HW,WOS:000727090500001,34865594,,,,2022/4/10,

Yet vast literatures on political communication focus almost exclusively on what words were spoken, entirely ignoring how they were delivered-auditory cues that convey emotion, signal positions, and establish reputation. We develop a model that opens this information to principled statistical inquiry: the model of audio and speech structure (MASS). Our approach models political speech as a stochastic process shaped by fixed and time-varying covariates, including the history of the conversation itself. In an application to Supreme Court oral arguments, we demonstrate how vocal tone signals crucial information-skepticism of legal arguments-that is indecipherable to text models. Results show that justices do not use questioning to strategically manipulate their peers but rather engage sincerely with the presented arguments. Our easy-to-use R package, communication, implements the model and many more tools for audio analysis.","[Knox, Dean] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lucas, Christopher] Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, St Louis, MO 14263 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Washington University (WUSTL),"Knox, D (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",dcknox@upenn.edu; christopher.lucas@wustl.edu,"Knox, Dean/AGF-3054-2022",/0000-0002-1945-7938,Analytics at Wharton; Schmidt DataX Fund at Princeton University; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1122374]; Microsoft Research Computational Social Science postdoctoral researcher program,"For excellent research assistance, we thank Taylor Damann.

Through a close examination of seminal content analyses, their methodologies and findings, this article proposes a framework that consolidates dimensional components of data visualisations previously scattered across this body of research. To transition from incidental and essentialist examinations of visual data artefacts towards a systematic and theory-informed exploration, we consider the diagrammatic dimensions of data visualisations. The offered synthesized framework can serve as a starting point for both theory-infused descriptive purposes as well as more theory-guided explorations. The framework is put to the test by analysing 185 visualisations drawn from award-winning data stories. Findings generated through the application of the framework highlight the varied composition of components of data visualisations, though certain combinations of components are prevalent, leading to static categorical comparisons or interactive spatial localization. After all, data artefacts can be understood as problem-posing elements that are the outcome of diagrammatic thinking that journalists employ to communicate claims.","[Stalph, Florian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Commun Studies & Media Res, Munich, Germany; [Heravi, Bahareh] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Informat & Commun Studies, Dublin, Ireland",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Munich; University College Dublin,"Heravi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Informat & Commun Studies, Dublin, Ireland.",bahareh.heravi@ucd.ie,,"Stalph, Florian/0000-0003-4018-0918",,,,50,0,0,10,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Simulation models help explore hypothetical and unprecedented scenarios, serving as powerful hypothesis generators for future theoretical and empirical research. This Special Issue showcases a collection of studies that demonstrate the analytical potential and methodological contribution of agent-based modeling (ABM) for media and communication research. In this introduction, we highlight five major benefits of this modeling approach to communication scholarship: (1) formalization, (2) understanding, (3) explanation, (4) prediction, and (5) exploration. We then present the four studies of this special issue, which contribute methodologically and theoretically to diverse key areas of communication: the emergence of meanings; political deliberation; information diffusion; and media use and social influence. We conclude with outlining future perspectives of ABM in communication research.","[Waldherr, Annie] Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Kolingasse 14, D-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Hilbert, Martin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA USA; [Gonzalez-Bailon, Sandra] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Vienna; University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Pennsylvania,"Waldherr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Commun, Kolingasse 14, D-1090 Vienna, Austria.",annie.waldherr@univie.ac.at,,"Waldherr, Annie/0000-0001-7488-9138",,,,82,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

This gatekeeping power was not won by journalists in a contest with others, or imposed on audiences, but was instead the unavoidable consequence of structural constraints in the production, distribution, and consumption of news in the pre-digital environment. This article examines this structural selectivity in journalism, identifies the kinds of news stories that may be more difficult to tell selectively and questions whether the structural constraints that require selectivity are still relevant in the digital news ecosystem. A systematic alternative to selective journalism, in which every story within a domain is covered in the same way, is described. Several examples of systematic journalism implemented in newsrooms in the US and UK are provided, and the public service motivations for their systematic coverage is emphasised. Systematic journalism is positioned as fundamentally, not incrementally, different from selective journalism in its characteristics and outcomes, and some of those characteristics are reviewed. A description of systematic journalism as it might be applied to climate change news stories is then developed. Finally, some of the broader challenges and implications of systematic forms of journalism are discussed.","[Caswell, David] British Broadcasting Corp, BBC News Labs, Portland Pl, London, England",,"Caswell, D (通讯作者)，British Broadcasting Corp, BBC News Labs, Portland Pl, London, England.",david@structuredstories.com,,,,,,45,0,0,3,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

A total of 17,049 Reddit posts from three major LIS-related subreddits were harvested through Pushshift by Python. Manual and computational coding methods were used to identify linguistic characteristics of the posts as well as the topicality of the content. Multiple logistic regressions were used to analyze the relationship between psychological and emotional characteristics of the posts and user engagement. Results showed that the majority of posts did not mention a specific type of LIS organization; of the subset that did, public libraries and academic libraries were most frequently referenced. Library services and usage was the topic most mentioned within LIS-related subreddits, followed by librarians and jobs. Various psychological features of posts including emotional tone score, authentic score, clout score, analytic score, and usage of words related to affective processes, anxiety, social processes, causation, and time were significantly related to user engagement. This study contributes to further understanding of social identity theory and social media engagement within the online communication context of LIS community. Key topics and issues in the LIS field and practical suggestions for strategies to improve social media engagement across LIS community were discussed.","[Ming, Yue] Kent State Univ, Commun & Informat, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Ming, Yue] Kent State Univ, Publ Hlth, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Matteson, Miriam L.] Kent State Univ, Sch Informat, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Matteson, Miriam L.] Kent State Univ, Coll Commun & Informat, 318 Univ Lib,1125 Risman Dr, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Sun, Jingchen] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Univ Lib, Sci & Engn, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kentucky State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kentucky State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kentucky State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kentucky State University; Kent State University Kent; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","Ming, Y (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Coll Commun & Informat, 318 Univ Lib,1125 Risman Dr, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",yming@kent.edu,"Ming, Yue/AAZ-5348-2021","Ming, Yue/0000-0002-5682-9817",,,,53,0,0,1,1,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0961-0006,1741-6477,,J LIBR INF SCI,J.

This also empowers the person whose behavior is being observed: By intelligently modifying her actions, she can influence the mental representations that an observer ascribes to her, and by extension, what the observer comes to believe about the world. That is, she can engage in intentionally communicative demonstrations. Here, we develop a computational account of generating and interpreting communicative demonstrations by explicitly distinguishing between two interacting types of planning. Typically, instrumental planning aims to control states of the environment, whereas belief-directed planning aims to influence an observer's mental representations. Our framework extends existing formal models of pragmatics and pedagogy to the setting of value-guided decision-making, captures how people modify their intentional behavior to show what they know about the reward or causal structure of an environment, and helps explain data on infant and child imitation in terms of literal versus pragmatic interpretation of adult demonstrators' actions. Additionally, our analysis of belief-directed intentionality and mentalizing sheds light on the sociocognitive mechanisms that underlie distinctly human forms of communication, culture, and sociality.","[Ho, Mark K.] Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, South Dr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA; [Cushman, Fiery] Harvard Univ, Dept Psychol, 33 Kirkland St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Littman, Michael L.] Brown Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Austerweil, Joseph L.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Psychol, 1202 W Johnson St, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Princeton University; Harvard University; Brown University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Ho, MK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Comp Sci, South Dr, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.",mho@princeton.edu,,"Ho, Mark/0000-0002-1454-4768",UW-Madison; Advanced Computing Initiative; Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF); Wisconsin Institutes for Discovery; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); U.S. Department of Energy's Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE); Office of the CVGRE at UW-Madison; WARF; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-19-12025]; John Templeton Foundation [61061],"This research was performed using the compute resources and assistance of the UW-Madison Center For High Throughput Computing (CHTC) in the Department of Computer Sciences.

The public availability of data sets is thus a necessary precondition for reliable and replicable research. These data allow researchers to benchmark the computational methods they develop, test the generalizability of their findings, and build confidence in their results. When social media data are concerned, data sharing is often restricted for legal or privacy reasons, which makes the comparison of methods and the replicability of research results infeasible. Social media analytics research, consequently, faces an integrity crisis. How is it possible to create trust in computational or statistical analyses, when they cannot be validated by third parties? In this work, we explore this well-known, yet little discussed, problem for social media analytics. We investigate how this problem can be solved by looking at related computational research areas. Moreover, we propose and implement a prototype to address the problem in the form of a new evaluation framework that enables the comparison of algorithms without the need to exchange data directly, while maintaining flexibility for the algorithm design.","[Assenmacher, Dennis; Trautmann, Heike] Univ Munster, Grp Data Sci Stat & Optimizat, Dept Informat Syst, Munster, Germany; [Grimme, Christian] Univ Munster, Informat Syst, Dept Informat Systems, Munster, Germany; [Assenmacher, Dennis] Queensland Univ Technol QUT, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Weber, Derek] Univ Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Neumann, Frank] Univ Adelaide, Optimisat & Logist Grp, Sch Comp Sci, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Weber, Derek] Australian Capital Terr, Def Sci & Technol Grp, Dept Def, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Preuss, Mike] Leiden Univ, LIACS, Inst Comp Sci, Leiden, Netherlands; [Calero Valdez, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Human Comp Interact Ctr, Aachen, Germany; [Bradshaw, Alison] Alison Bradshaw Legal, Glenside, SA, Australia; [Ross, Bjorn] Univ Edinburgh, Computat Social Sci, Sch Informat, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Cresci, Stefano] Inst Informat & Telemat IIT CNR, Pisa, Italy",University of Munster; University of Munster; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Adelaide; University of Adelaide; Defence Science & Technology; League of European Research Universities - LERU; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; RWTH Aachen University; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Edinburgh; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Informatica e Telematica (IIT-CNR),"Assenmacher, D (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",dennis.assenmacher@wi.uni-muenster.de,"Cresci, Stefano/Q-4031-2018; Ross, Björn/AAT-6901-2020","Cresci, Stefano/0000-0003-0170-2445; Ross, Björn/0000-0003-2717-3705; Assenmacher, Dennis/0000-0001-9219-1956","German Federal Ministry of Education and ResearchFederal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [FKZ 16KIS0495K]; Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia [FKZ 005-1709-0001, EFRE-0801431, FKZ 005-1709-0006]; European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS); DAAD PPP Germany-Australia [57511656]; EU H2020 Program under the scheme INFRAIA-01-2018-2019: Research and Innovation action grant [871042]","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dennis Assenmacher, Christian Grimme, Mike Preuss, and Heike Trautmann acknowledge support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (FKZ 16KIS0495K), the Ministry of Culture and Science of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (FKZ 005-1709-0001, EFRE-0801431, and FKZ 005-1709-0006), and the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS).

A computational social science methodology was adopted using a mixed-method application of social network analysis and machine learning-based topic modelling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm on a 600,000-text corpus extracted from the Facebook posts. Results showed that political, economic, and legal posts had dense clusters around the technology policy of EV, the institutional discourse of electrification of the federal vehicle fleet, and tax and credit framework politics. The environmental and social dimensions had a higher discourse for social justice, clean air, and better health and well-being.

I argue that movement leaders seek to achieve high user engagement for utilizing mechanisms of information diffusion to increase both online and on-site mobilization. In a case study, I analyze the German right-wing movement Pegida, which uses Facebook for spreading its anti-Islam agenda online. Data from Pegida's Facebook page are combined with news reports over a period of 18 months to measure activity on Facebook and in the public sphere simultaneously. Results of quantitative text and time series analysis show that Pegida cannot influence user engagement by simply creating more posts. Instead, it is the content of posts that matters. Moreover, findings highlight a strong connection between Facebook activities and the public sphere. In times of decreasing attention, the movement changes its social media strategy in response to exogenous shocks: Pegida resorts increasingly to radical mobilization methods by posting xenophobic content that is more likely to incite users to engage on Facebook.","[Schwemmer, Carsten] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Mannheim, Germany; [Schwemmer, Carsten] Univ Bamberg, Polit Sociol, Bamberg, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Schwemmer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bamberg, Feldkirchenstr 21, D-96052 Bamberg, Germany.",c.schwem2er@gmail.com,,,,,,45,1,1,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

Against the background of a hybrid media system, we pursue three research goals. First, we evaluate the scope of the Twitter-in-the-news phenomenon relative to news coverage as a whole. Second, we examine the functions of embedded tweets. Third, we identify characteristics that increase the likelihood that tweets will be selected for publication in a news article. We combine computational methods with a manual content analysis and analyze political news coverage of one month outside election periods in four German online news outlets. Our results show that embedding tweets in the news is not a niche phenomenon but has been established as a routine journalistic practice to a moderate extent. In the majority of news articles, the function of tweets is to illustrate an argument or information provided in the text. Geographical proximity and - with some dependencies - the number of popularity cues increased the likelihood of a tweet to be picked up for reporting. The paper shows how transformation processes currently observed in journalism manifest themselves in reporting.","[Oschatz, Corinna] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany; [Stier, Sebastian] GESIS Leibniz Inst Social Sci, Dept Computat Social Sci, Cologne, Germany; [Maier, Juergen] Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Polit Sci, Landau, Germany",University of Koblenz & Landau; Leibniz Institut fur Sozialwissenschaften (GESIS); University of Koblenz & Landau,"Oschatz, C (通讯作者)，Univ Koblenz Landau, Dept Commun Psychol & Media Educ, Landau, Germany.",oschatz@uni-landau.de,"Stier, Sebastian/AAH-4394-2019; Maier, Jürgen/ABH-7963-2020","Stier, Sebastian/0000-0002-1217-5778; Maier, Jürgen/0000-0001-8301-5125; Oschatz, Corinna/0000-0003-3276-5721",,,,53,5,5,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Following this lens, we suggest an extended model of sustained social influence (that considers retweets as the measure of user influence) as a function of the duality of individual Twitter users' social actions and the underlying facilitating Twitter network structure. Based on an analysis of organic large-scale Twitter data on this social movement, we examine how characteristics of individuals' social actions, namely activity and tenure on Twitter, and characteristics facilitated by the network (i.e., the number of followers as well as centrality in the community structure of Twitter), impact retweet influence in time windows spanning the movement. Utilizing a mixed methods approach consisting of machine learning and human coding we conceptualize social movement-related engagement activities of Twitter users, which map to generic frames of social movement mobilization. The analysis reveals interesting patterns across different contexts of the Egyptian Revolution. Regarding individual social action, social movement related to who and where activities, as well as tenure, were found to contribute to individual social influence. In terms of the facilitating structure, the follower network (an observed network structure) and centrality (an unobserved network structure) were both found to contribute significantly to sustained influence.","[Venkatesan, Srikanth] Cal Poly Pomona, Coll Business Adm, Dept Comp Informat Syst, Pomona, CA 91768 USA; [Valecha, Rohit; Rao, H.

This also means they are easily polarized, not only ideologically but also in their actions. Affective polarization is the emotional tendency for people to show animosity toward opposing partisans while seeking homogeneity from fellow partisans. Much research into online affective polarization has focused on quantifying anxiety at an individual level while neglecting that on a collective basis. Therefore, this paper examined the polarization of collective anxiety in topic-based communities on Weibo. Methods: We aim to interpret correlations between collective anxiety online and topic characteristics, user competence, as well as the proportion of influencers of Weibo topic-based communities. Our neural networks model and statistical analysis were based on 200 communities with 403,380 personal accounts and 1,012,830 messages. Results: Collective anxiety levels are correlated to (1) the extent to which a topic captures public interest, (2) how community members articulate topics on social network platforms, and (3) the ratio of influencers in the community. Specifically, people's conflicting perceptions and articulations of topics might increase collective anxiety, while the extent to which a topic is of the public interest and the number of influencers engaged in a topic account for any decline in its ranking. Furthermore, familiarity with a topic does not help predict collective anxiety levels. There are no significant links between community size or interactivity dynamics and the level of collective anxiety in the topic-based community. Our computational model has 85.00% precision and 87.00% recall. Conclusion: This study found the collective anxiety augment due to topic proximities to public interest and members' lack of declarative knowledge on topics, while to decline with an increasing portion of online influencers. These findings indicate that collective anxiety is induced due to a lack of credibility. Also, the amount of conflicting information shared by different people places them in a state of flux. Therefore, a community with more influencers may be more likely to experience anxiety polarization, bringing forth the issue of layered information and inequality.","[Yang, Yi] Beijing Int Studies Univ, Sch Chinese Culture & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ta, Na; Hu, Baijing] Renmin Univ China, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Kaiyu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiao, Fang] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Journalism & Commun, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhanghao] Beijing Normal Univ, Computat Commun Res Ctr, Zhuhai, Peoples R China; [Li, Zhanghao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Zhuhai, Peoples R China",Beijing International Studies University; Renmin University of China; Tsinghua University; Chinese University of Hong Kong; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Ta, N (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tanayun@ruc.edu.cn,,"TA, Na/0000-0002-6644-3467","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61802414]; Journalism and Marxism Research Center, Renmin University of China [MXG201907]; Social Science Foundation of Beijing [18XCC011]; Humanities and Social Sciences Base Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [16JJD860008]","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61802414, the Journalism and Marxism Research Center, Renmin University of China under Grant No. MXG201907, the Social Science Foundation of Beijing under Grant No. 18XCC011, and the Humanities and Social Sciences Base Foundation of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 16JJD860008.",,91,0,0,8,8,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-1078,,,FRONT PSYCHOL,Front.

This research aims to examine how media coverage of the election has been framed with infographics through mixed methods analysis.

Digital Journalism 4 (7): 944-954. doi:) by conducting interviews with data reporters. The mixed methods textual and visual analysis shows that framing the election as a game is still relevant for the election data reporting. Analysis of graphics before the election has demonstrated the prevalent game frame trend in data visualization pieces. However, this pattern has changed after the election with increased priority for the issue frame and policy coverage. Results have demonstrated that journalists tend to reinforce the game frame in the infographics. That phenomenon leads to a potential increase in political polarization and political skepticism. Analysis of the interviews with data journalists from two newsrooms shows that professional work routines affect their reporting and reinforce the detrimental influence of framing on the election coverage.","[Alieva, Iuliia] Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Alieva, I (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Sch Journalism, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",iuliia.alieva@gmail.com,"Alieva, Iuliia/ABA-7423-2021","Alieva, Iuliia/0000-0001-6270-8985",,,,83,0,0,4,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

To this end, we rely on two studies that combine two-wave panel surveys (N1 = 303, N2 = 904) with twelve months worth of web browsing data submitted by the same participants comprising roughly thirty-eight million visits. We identify news exposure using an extensive list of news domains and develop a machine learning classifier to identify exposure to political news within these domains. The results offer a robust pattern of null findings. Exposure to partisan and centrist news websites-no matter if it is congenial or crosscutting-does not enhance polarization. These null effects also emerge among strong and weak partisans as well as Democrats and Republicans alike. We argue that these null results accurately portray the reality of limited effects of news in the real world. Politics and partisan news account for a small fraction of citizens' online activities, less than 2 percent in our trace data, and are nearly unnoticeable in the overall information and communication ecology of most individuals.","[Wojcieszak, Magdalena] Univ Calif Davis, Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Lee, Seungsu] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Wojcieszak, Magdalena] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [de Leeuw, Sjifra] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Menchen-Trevino, Ericka] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Huang-Isherwood, Ke M.] Univ Southern Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun & Journalism, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Weeks, Brian] Univ Michigan, Dept Commun, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; American University; University of Southern California; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Wojcieszak, M (通讯作者)，One Shields Ave,Kerr Hall 478, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",mwojcieszak@ucdavis.edu,"Menchen-Trevino, Ericka/B-5690-2013","Menchen-Trevino, Ericka/0000-0002-5029-8269; /0000-0002-6360-3285",European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [EXPO-756301],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Research Council, Europeans exposed to dissimilar views in the media: investigating backfire effects, Proposal EXPO-756301 (ERC Starting Grant, Magdalena Wojcieszak-PI).

Focusing on political sorting in networks, we develop a computational model that examines how social network structure changes when individuals participate in information cascades, evaluate their behavior, and potentially rewire their connections to others as a result. Individuals follow proattitudinal information sources but are more likely to first hear and react to news shared by their social ties and only later evaluate these reactions by direct reference to the coverage of their preferred source. Reactions to news spread through the network via a complex contagion. Following a cascade, individuals who determine that their participation was driven by a subjectively unimportant story adjust their social ties to avoid being misled in the future. In our model, this dynamic leads social networks to politically sort when news outlets differentially report on the same topic, even when individuals do not know others' political identities. Observational follow network data collected on Twitter support this prediction: We find that individuals in more polarized information ecosystems lose cross-ideology social ties at a rate that is higher than predicted by chance. Importantly, our model reveals that these emergent polarized networks are less efficient at diffusing information: Individuals avoid what they believe to be unimportant news at the expense of missing out on subjectively important news far more frequently. This suggests that echo chambers-to the extent that they exist-may not echo so much as silence.","[Tokita, Christopher K.; Tarnita, Corina E.] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Guess, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Dept Polit, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Guess, Andrew M.] Princeton Univ, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Tokita, CK (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",christopher.tokita@gmail.com,"Guess, Andrew/J-4904-2019","Guess, Andrew/0000-0003-2974-7848; Tokita, Christopher/0000-0002-8585-4317",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE1656466]; Princeton Data-Driven Social Science Initiative,"We are grateful to Richard A.

The lack of understanding of key aspects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incorporate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families.","[Araya, Roberto] Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 8320000, Chile; [Isoda, Masami] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058577, Japan; [van der Molen Moris, Johan] Univ Cambridge, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge CB2 0SR, England",Universidad de Chile; University of Tsukuba; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Cambridge; MRC Biostatistics Unit,"Araya, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Educ, Ctr Adv Res Educ, Santiago 8320000, Chile.; Moris, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, MRC Biostat Unit, Cambridge CB2 0SR, England.",roberto.araya.schulz@gmail.com; isoda@criced.tsukuba.ac.jp; johan.vdmolen@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk,,"Araya, Roberto/0000-0003-2598-8994","ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence [FB0003]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19K21743]","FundingThis work was supported by the Chilean National Agency for Research and Development (ANID), grant number ANID/PIA/Basal Funds for Centers of Excellence FB0003, and by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant-in-Aid for Exploratory Research 19K21743.",,87,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

The underlying hypotheses that guide the whole article, confirmed by the research results, concern the existence of (a) a limited number of elements at the base of each popular hashtag with very high viral power and (b) hashtags transversal to the themes detected by the Twitter algorithm that define specific opinion polls. Through computational techniques, it was possible to extract and process data sets from six specific hashtags highlighted by TT. In a first step through social network analysis, we analyzed the hashtag semantic network to identify the hashtags transversal to the six TTs. Subsequently, we selected for each data set the contents with high sharing power and created a potential opinion leader index to identify users with influencer characteristics. Finally, a cross section of social actors able to guide public opinion in the Twittersphere emerged from the intersection between potentially influential users and the viral contents.","[Russo, Vanessa] Univ G dAnnunzio, Computat Social Res Lab, Dept Law & Social Sci, Chieti, Italy; [del Gobbo, Emiliano] Univ G dAnnunzio, Via Vestini 31, I-66100 Chieti, Italy; [del Gobbo, Emiliano] Univ Foggia, Dept Humanities, Foggia, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; University of Foggia,"Russo, V (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Via Vestini 31, I-66100 Chieti, Italy.",v.russo@unich.it; emiliano.delgobbo@unifg.it,,"del Gobbo, Emiliano/0000-0003-1088-7306",,,,36,0,0,8,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

An extensive line of scholarly work had pointed to the existence of two alternative news frames; public order and debate. We argue that prior work may have been limited by the reliance on deductive strategies using predefined, theoretically-driven frames. Using a data-driven computational method, the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), we examine mainstream news' framing of two contentious protests that took place during Donald Trump's presidency; Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA (n = 1231 news articles), and the Black Lives Matter protests (n = 2810). In addition to the frames found in past research, we identify a prominent Politics frame, often focussing on the role of Trump in inciting and reacting to racial tensions. An in-depth analysis of the application of frames to each protest revealed a nuanced use of the Protest Paradigm. We suggest possible revisions to existing theories, and discuss the potential social and political implications of our findings.","[Ophir, Yotam; Neurohr, Madison] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, Dept Commun, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Forde, Devin K.] Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, 333 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [Walter, Dror] Georgia State Univ, Dept Commun, Digital Media, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Massignan, Virginia] Georgia State Univ, Dept Commun, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Ophir, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Buffalo State Univ New York, 333 Baldy Hall, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",yotamoph@buffalo.edu,,"Ophir, Yotam/0000-0001-5049-7906",,,,49,1,1,8,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211036622,,Aug-21,19,Communication,,Communication,UA0VK,WOS:000684883000001,,,,,2022/4/10,

Mutual understanding is especially challenging when patients have limited health literacy (HL). Two strategies hypothesized to improve communication include matching the complexity of language to patients' HL (universal tailoring); or always using simple language (universal precautions). Through computational linguistic analysis of 237,126 email exchanges between dyads of 1094 physicians and 4331 English-speaking patients, we assessed matching (concordance/discordance) between physicians' linguistic complexity and patients' HL, and classified physicians' communication strategies. Among low HL patients, discordance was associated with poor understanding (P = 0.046). Physicians' universal tailoring strategy was associated with better understanding for all patients (P = 0.01), while universal precautions was not. There was an interaction between concordance and communication strategy (P = 0.021): The combination of dyadic concordance and universal tailoring eliminated HL-related disparities. Physicians' ability to adapt communication to match their patients' HL promotes shared understanding and equity.

These networks are formed through not only direct contact with social/sex partners but also indirect anonymous contacts encountered when attending social venues. We introduced a new application of a state-of-the-art graph-based deep learning method to predict HIV infection that can identify influential neighbors within these multiple network contexts. Design and methods: We used empirical network data among YMSM aged 16-29 years old collected from Houston and Chicago in the United States between 2014 and 2016. A computational framework GAT-HIV (Graph Attention Networks for HIV) was proposed to predict HIV infections by identifying influential neighbors within social networks. These networks were formed by multiple relations constituted of social/sex partners and shared venue attendances, and using individual-level variables. Further, GAT-HIV was extended to combine multiple social networks using multigraph GAT methods. A visualization tool was also developed to highlight influential network members for each individual within the multiple social networks. Results: The multigraph GAT-HIV models obtained average AUC values of 0.776 and 0.824 for Chicago and Houston, respectively, performing better than empirical predictive models (e.g. AUCs of random forest: 0.758 and 0.798). GAT-HIV on single networks also delivered promising prediction performances. Conclusion: The proposed methods provide a comprehensive and interpretable framework for graph-based modeling that may inform effective HIV prevention intervention strategies among populations most vulnerable to HIV.","[Xiang, Yang; Li, Fang; Wang, Qing; Zhi, Degui; Tao, Cui] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Fujimoto, Kayo] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Promot & Behav Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Del Vecchio, Natascha; Schneider, John] Univ Chicago, Chicago Ctr HIV Eliminat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schneider, John] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Schneider, John] Univ Chicago, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Tao, C (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Biomed Informat, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",Cui.Tao@uth.tmc.edu,,"Tao, Cui/0000-0002-4267-1924","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R56AI150272, R01MH100021, R21AI139480, R01DA039934]","We thank Dr Irmgard Willcockson for proofreading.

We also show how polarized clustering of outlets translates to differences in the topics of news covered and the style and tone of articles published. In addition, we demonstrate how contributors who cross partisan divides tend to focus on less explicitly political topics.

We carried out stratified analyses among White/non-Hispanics, Black/non-Hispanics, Hispanics, and Asian/Pacific Islanders to determine if the Literacy Profile has comparable criterion and predictive validities. We discovered that criterion validity was consistently high across all groups (c-statistics 0.82-0.89). We observed consistent relationships across racial/ethnic groups between HL and outcomes, including communication, adherence, hypoglycemia, diabetes control, and ED utilization.

Taking the psychometric paradigm as its point of departure and applying combination of computational and statistical methods, we identify 34 sources of cyber risk. The actions of government turn out to have a significant impact on public attention to the different sources of cyber risk, an influence that has been neglected in past research. The dynamics of societal aversion against most cyber risk sources are found to present inverted-U shapes. Adaptation and learning effects are found to explain this dynamic. Another finding is that news sentiment has a strong correlation with cyber risk perception, an insight of importance for regulators and insurers.","[Xu, Wei; Murphy, Finbarr] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Accounting & Finance, Limerick, Ireland; [Xu, Wei; Xu, Xian] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Insurance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Xing, Wenpeng] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Limerick; Fudan University; Hong Kong Baptist University,"Xu, W (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Dept Accounting & Finance, Limerick, Ireland.",Wei.Xu@ul.ie,,"xing, wenpeng/0000-0001-5848-9417; , Wei/0000-0002-2321-6424",,,,87,1,1,7,10,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

This special issue therefore discusses approaches which examine the linguistic representation of risk in text and how it changes over time. With the increasing body of digitised text available for research, scholars are now able to use advanced quantitative content analysis, text mining technologies, and corpus linguistic computational tools for the analysis of large text corpora. These advancements are also useful for risk studies and social science research. Specifically, the news media and other bodies of large text (corpora) built from, for example, parliamentary debate, social media, or government websites, have become a valuable resource for the analysis of language and discourse of risk which can be used to better understand the dynamics of risk communication in the public sphere. The contributions exemplify different research strategies by means of a number of case studies (e.g. terrorism, obesity, fracking, climate change, pre-exposure prophylaxis, migration as well as diachronic analysis of the use of risk in parliamentary debate and news coverage) and discuss key aspects of applying such research tools. This introduction outlines the central features of different ways to approach risk through discourse and language, before highlighting unresolved issues and the prospects for research and methodology of corpus-based risk studies and, finally, introducing the contributions.","[Zinn, Jens O.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Mueller, Marcus] Tech Univ, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Darmstadt, Germany",University of Melbourne; Technical University of Darmstadt,"Zinn, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.",jzinn@unimelb.edu.au,,"Muller, Marcus/0000-0003-4921-4512; Zinn, Jens Oliver/0000-0002-4992-9123",,,,97,1,1,6,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-9877,1466-4461,,J RISK RES,J.

This paper focuses on the low-carbohydrate (LC) diet, which gained large publicity in Finland in late 2010, affecting eating habits and food sales. In order to understand the factors affecting its emergence, we turned to the internet because it is a key environment where enthusiasts meet and new phenomena are forged. By analyzing the prevalence of keywords on carbohydrate-conscious eating in a database of over one billion social media messages in 2001-17, we found two peaks of activity - in 2002-07 and 2011-13. We then used innovative computational text-mining methods to compare the language about the LC diet in the two peaks to seek an explanation for why it became trendy in Finland only in 2011. While the key semantic fields remained roughly the same between the two peak periods on a general level, when the granularity of the model was increased, differences between individual cluster communities were detected that attest to the growing importance and mainstreaming of the diet. The results and the presented method are significant to public health and food industry actors, who want to track emerging food phenomena in the current fast-moving media environments.","[Jauho, Mikko; Poyry, Essi; Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Paakkonen, Juho] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci Sociol, Helsinki, Finland; [Isotalo, Veikko] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci Polit Sci, Helsinki, Finland",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki,"Jauho, M (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Consumer Soc Res, Helsinki, Finland.",mikko.jauho@helsinki.fi; essi.poyry@helsinki.fi; salla.laaksonen@helsinki.fi,,"Laaksonen, Salla-Maaria/0000-0003-3532-2387",Business Finland [4161/31/2016],This work was supported by Business Finland under Grant 4161/31/2016.,,90,0,0,4,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1552-8014,1751-7443,,FOOD CULT SOC,Food Cult.

To understand how and how much news media cover climate change, this study compares coverage in ten countries from the Global North and the Global South between 2006 and 2018 (N = 71,674). Based on a panel analysis, we illustrate that news media attention varies across countries and is often associated with political, scientific, and (partly) societal focusing events. Based on an automated content analysis, we also find that news media do not only cover ecological changes or climate science, but that they focus predominantly on the societal dimension of climate change: They emphasize how humans are aware of, affected by, battle, or cause climate change. Overall, the study illustrates important differences between the Global North and the Global South. While countries from the Global North cover climate change more frequently, countries from the Global South focus more on its challenges and implications for society at large, i.e., the societal dimension of climate change.","[Hase, Valerie; Mahl, Daniela; Schafer, Mike S.] Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Keller, Tobias R.] Gfs Bern, Bern, Switzerland",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Zurich,"Hase, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Commun & Media Res, Andreasstr 15, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland.",v.hase@ikmz.uzh.ch,,"Hase, Valerie/0000-0001-6656-4894; Mahl, Daniela/0000-0002-5330-6885","German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [EXC 177]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [IZBRZ1_186296, P2ZHP1_184082]","This work was supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) [EXC 177] and the Swiss National Science Foundation [IZBRZ1_186296, P2ZHP1_184082].",,91,1,1,20,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0959-3780,1872-9495,,GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG,Glob.

However, close-up, qualitative sociological research has not been conducted into the relationship between Brexit and social media use. This is, in part, due to the computational turn in online research, which has led to a disproportionate focus on quantitative big data analysis. This article argues for the value of close-up, qualitative enquiry to facilitate situated understandings of the reality of social media use and what it means to individuals. It outlines one such methodology developed to investigate pro-Leave Facebook users, to demonstrate how challenges posed by such research can be overcome, and the opportunities such enquiry affords for studying the role of social media in contentious politics. Invaluable insights gained include the way Facebook provides an empowering tool for making claims to political knowledge in the context of growing transnational nativist and populist grievances.","[Hall, Natalie-Anne] Loughborough Univ, Online Civ Culture Ctr, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Hall, NA (通讯作者)，Loughborough Univ, Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Brockington Bldg, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",n.hall@lboro.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by a doctoral studentship from the Economic and Social Research Council North West Social Science Doctoral Training Partnership.",,77,0,0,9,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1360-7804,,,SOCIOL RES ONLINE,Sociol.

Informed by institutional theory and stakeholder theory, this article systematically, comparatively, and computationally examines the intersection of LGBTQ advocacy and CSR communication. In particular, it contributes to the literature by (1) examining the global LGBTQ CSR discourse constructed by Fortune Global 500 companies (136,820 words) with semantic network analysis and structural topic modeling; (2) surveying non-profit organizations' guidelines and comparing corporate values with them; and (3) exploring how stakeholder expectations and institutional factors influence CSR communication. Results indicate 6 corporate topics and 9 non-profit topics, which were explicated by referencing organizations' original writing. It is further shown that stakeholder expectations and institutional factors not only affect whether or not corporations report LGBTQ efforts, but also affect what topics they highlight in CSR reports. Corporations in democratic countries with substantial stakeholder expectations emphasize areas that need high investment and exceed legal obligations.","[Zhou, Alvin] Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19143 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Zhou, A (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Annenberg Sch Commun, 3620 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA 19143 USA.",alvinyxz@upenn.edu,,,,,,104,1,1,9,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0363-8111,1873-4537,,PUBLIC RELAT REV,Public Relat.

A less explored area, however, is how these divides relate to potential divides in morality. The Habermasian conceptualization of the public sphere prioritizes deliberative reasoning as a way to solve moral conflicts. In contrast, this study argues that divides in reasoning and opinion are associated with divides in morality. To make the argument, this study focuses on the case of public debates over whether social media companies should deplatform Trump and his supporters in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Public comments were obtained from a dataset compiled and released by Facebook Oversight Board. First, I used structural topic modeling to identify the reasoning and used the dictionary based on the Moral Foundations Theory to gauge moral foundations in each document. Then, I used statistical analysis to examine whether there was a correlation between specific reasoning and moral foundations. The results show that the pro- and anti-deplatforming camps in the debate are divided not only in reasoning, but also in morality. Supporters of deplatforming argue that it would fulfill tech companies' public responsibility, and protect society at large. These arguments are correlated with the care foundation. In contrast, opponents argue that deplatforming Trump violated freedom of speech. This argument is correlated with the fairness, loyalty, and authority foundations, but not the care foundation. The findings support my argument that divides in reasoning should be analyzed with consideration of morality.","[Luo, Zhifan] York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada",York University - Canada,"Luo, ZF (通讯作者)，York Univ, Inst Res Digital Literacies, Toronto, ON, Canada.",luozhifan0310@gmail.com,,"Luo, Zhifan/0000-0001-5572-5680",,,,63,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

This study used a cost- and -time effective framework to leverage, aggregate, and analyze data from social media. This paper enhances our understanding of diet-related discussions with respect to political orientations in U.S. states. This mixed methods study used computational methods to collect tweets containing diet or #diet shared in a year, identified tweets posted by U.S. Twitter users, disclosed topics of tweets, and compared democratic, republican, and swing states based on the weight of topics. A qualitative method was employed to code topics. We found 32 unique topics extracted from more than 800,000 tweets, including a wide range of themes, such as diet types and chronic conditions. Based on the comparative analysis of the topic weights, our results revealed a significant difference between democratic, republican, and swing states. The largest difference was detected between swing and democratic states, and the smallest difference was identified between swing and republican states. Our study provides initial insight on the association of potential political leanings with health (e.g., dietary behaviors). Our results show diet discussions differ depending on the political orientation of the state in which Twitter users reside. Understanding the correlation of dietary preferences based on political orientation can help develop targeted and effective health promotion, communication, and policymaking strategies.","[Karami, Amir] Univ South Carolina, Sch Informat Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Dahl, Alicia A.; Shaw, George, Jr.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Valappil, Sruthi Puthan] Univ South Carolina, Comp Sci & Engn Dept, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle; Bozorgi, Parisa] Univ South Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Kharrazi, Hadi] Johns Hopkins Univ, Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Bozorgi, Parisa] South Carolina Dept Hlth & Environm Control, Columbia, SC 29201 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,"Karami, A (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Sch Informat Sci, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",karami@sc.edu; adahl3@uncc.edu; gshaw11@uncc.edu; sruthi@email.sc.edu; mcgrievy@mailbox.sc.edu; kharrazi@jhu.edu; bozorgip@email.sc.edu,"Kharrazi, Hadi/Q-1725-2015","Kharrazi, Hadi/0000-0003-1481-4323; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle/0000-0002-1683-5729; Karami, Amir/0000-0003-1936-7497",Advanced Support for Innovative Research Excellence (ASPIRE) grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research; Big Data Health Science Center (BDHSC) at the University of South Carolina,"This research was partially supported by the Advanced Support for Innovative Research Excellence (ASPIRE) grant from the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Big Data Health Science Center (BDHSC) at the University of South Carolina.

Such studies were previously limited by the cost and feasibility of large-scale surveys; however, language-based computational models applied to large social media datasets now allow for large-scale personality assessment. Method We applied a language-based assessment of the five factor model of personality to 6,064,267 U.S. Twitter users. We aggregated the Twitter-based personality scores to 2,041 counties and compared to political, economic, social, and health outcomes measured through surveys and by government agencies. Results There was significant personality variation across counties. Openness to experience was higher on the coasts, conscientiousness was uniformly spread, extraversion was higher in southern states, agreeableness was higher in western states, and emotional stability was highest in the south. Across 13 outcomes, language-based personality estimates replicated patterns that have been observed in individual-level and geographic studies. This includes higher Republican vote share in less agreeable counties and increased life satisfaction in more conscientious counties. Conclusions Results suggest that regions vary in their personality and that these differences can be studied through computational linguistic analysis of social media. Furthermore, these methods may be used to explore other psychological constructs across geographies.","[Giorgi, Salvatore; Ungar, Lyle H.] Univ Penn, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, 3701 Market St,Suite 222, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nguyen, Khoa Le] Univ N Carolina, Dept Psychol & Neurosci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA; [Eichstaedt, Johannes C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, Inst Human Ctr AI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kern, Margaret L.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Yaden, David.

We also focus on trustworthiness as a mediator and perceived homophily as a moderator to specify the underlying mechanisms through which self-disclosure valence affects first impression formation. The results from an online experiment (N = 204) suggest that self-disclosure valence has a significant effect on perceived trustworthiness and likability when individuals evaluate an unknown future collaborator using the social media profile. Trustworthiness mediates the effect of self-disclosure valence on likability when the individuals feel that they are dissimilar or even slightly similar to strangers. At that time, individuals tend to seek cues from both self-disclosure valence and perceived homophily to form the trustworthiness perception, and the influence of self-disclosure depends on the level of perceived homophily.","[Qin, Yuren; Cho, Hichang; Zhang, Lianshan] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Commun & New Media, Singapore, Singapore; [Li, Pengxiang] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; Shenzhen University,"Li, PX (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",lipx@szu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Fund of China [19ZDA324],"This work has been supported by Major Project of The National Social Science Fund of China (Grant/Award Number: 19ZDA324).

Our results show that the frequency of words that denote specific prejudice types related to ethnicity, gender, sexual, and religious orientation has markedly increased within the 2010-2019 decade across most news media outlets. This phenomenon starts prior to, but appears to accelerate after, 2015. The frequency of prejudice-denoting words in news articles is not synchronous across all outlets, with the yearly prevalence of such words in some influential news media outlets being predictive of those words' usage frequency in other outlets the following year. Increasing prevalence of prejudice-denoting words in news media discourse is often substantially correlated with U.S. public opinion survey data on growing perceptions of minorities' mistreatment. Granger tests suggest that the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in news outlets might be predictive of shifts in public perceptions of prejudice severity in society for some, but not all, types of prejudice.","[Rozado, David] ECL Otago Polytech, Forth St, Dunedin 9054, Otago, New Zealand; [Al-Gharbi, Musa] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Halberstadt, Jamin] Univ Otago, Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand",Columbia University; University of Otago,"Rozado, D (通讯作者)，ECL Otago Polytech, Forth St, Dunedin 9054, Otago, New Zealand.",david.rozado@op.ac.nz,"Rozado, David/O-6934-2014","Rozado, David/0000-0001-6849-4746",,,,59,2,2,7,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

The hope is that, by using computational social science methods to analyse large-scale observational data from social media, human behaviour can be studied with greater statistical power and ecological validity. However, current standards of null hypothesis significance testing and correlational statistics seem ill-suited to markedly noisy, high-dimensional social media datasets. We explore this point by probing the moral contagion phenomenon, whereby the use of moral-emotional language increases the probability of message spread. Through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, we find that the moral contagion model performs no better than an implausible XYZ contagion model. This highlights the risks of using purely correlational evidence from large observational datasets and sounds a cautionary note for psychology's merge with big data. Burton et al. probe the question of moral contagion through out-of-sample prediction, model comparisons and specification curve analyses, demonstrating the limitations of conclusions based on large-scale, observational social media datasets alone.","[Burton, Jason W.; Hahn, Ulrike] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, London, England; [Cruz, Nicole] Univ New South Wales, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Burton, JW (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, London, England.",jburto03@mail.bbk.ac.uk,"Kidd-Drake, Jennifer/AAU-6153-2021","Burton, Jason W./0000-0002-6797-2299",,,,45,4,4,11,18,NATURE PORTFOLIO,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2397-3374,,,NAT HUM BEHAV,Nat.

However, existing studies exhibit numerous methodological issues and inconsistencies with respect to research design and results reporting, which could lead to biased data, imprecise or incorrect conclusions, or incomparable results across studies. This article reports a systematic analysis of the literature with respect to such issues. The objective was to develop a standardized protocol for improving the research validity and comparability of results in future relevant studies. Materials and Methods: We developed the Protocol of Analysis of senTiment in Health (PATH) based on a systematic review that analyzed common research design choices and how such choices were made, or reported, among eligible studies published 2010-2019. Results: Of 409 articles screened, 89 met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16 distinctive research design choices were identified, 9 of which have significant methodological or reporting inconsistencies among the articles reviewed, ranging from how relevance of study data was determined to how the sentiment analysis tool selected was validated. Based on this result, we developed the PATH protocol that encompasses all these distinctive design choices and highlights the ones for which careful consideration and detailed reporting are particularly warranted. Conclusions: A substantial degree of methodological and reporting inconsistencies exist in the extant literature that applied sentiment analysis to analyzing health-related social media data. The PATH protocol developed through this research may contribute to mitigating such issues in future relevant studies.","[He, Lu; Yin, Tingjue; Hu, Zhaoxian; Chen, Yunan; Zheng, Kai] Univ Calif Irvine, Donald Bren Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Dept Informat, 6095 Donald Bren Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Hanauer, David A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Learning Hlth Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hanauer, David A.] Univ Michigan, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Zheng, Kai] Univ Calif Irvine, Sch Med, Dept Emergency Med, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Zheng, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Donald Bren Sch Informat & Comp Sci, Dept Informat, 6095 Donald Bren Hall, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",kai.zheng@uci.edu,,"He, Lu/0000-0003-0181-018X",National Center for Research ResourcesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Research Resources (NCRR); National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) [UL1TR001414],This work was supported in part by the National Center for Research Resources and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health through grant UL1TR001414.

Their application domains are as heterogeneous as software can be, from interfaces to new digital mediatic forms. This paper examines the relevance of software studies for journalism studies in the context of automated news production, where technological artifacts can also be understood as being shaped by professional values and cultural practices. It also explores methods nourished by software studies' theories to tackle news automation through a process-oriented approach. The cursor is placed on the materiality of the upstream components of automated news production: the data that feed the systems and the process that will make the news. Automated news production appears as a remixed editorial process nourished by previous editorial experiences that will be standardized through a some-how imitation game where technological and human mediation interplay. This paper addresses the issue of transparency with the flattening of the processes at work, relying on theories and methodological tools based on software studies.","[Dierickx, Laurence] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ReSIC, LaPIJ, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Dierickx, L (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ReSIC, Dept Sci Informat & Commun, Ave Antoine Depage 30, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",laurence.dierickx@ulb.ac.be,,"Dierickx, Laurence/0000-0001-5926-8720",,,,108,0,0,7,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,,,,,,,,,,,1.46E+16,10.1177/14648849211023872,,Jun-21,17,Communication,,Communication,SW1KF,WOS:000664275600001,,,,,2022/4/10,

Written text has been analyzed through both theory-based, closed-vocabulary methods from the social sciences as well as datadriven, open-vocabulary methods from computer science, but these approaches have not been comprehensively compared. To provide guidance on best practices for automatically analyzing written text, this narrative review and quantitative synthesis compares five predominant closed- and open-vocabulary methods: Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), the General Inquirer, DICTION, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and Differential Language Analysis. We compare the linguistic features associated with gender, age, and personality across the five methods using an existing dataset of Facebook status updates and self-reported survey data from 65,896 users. Results are fairly consistent across methods. The closed-vocabulary approaches efficiently summarize concepts and are helpful for understanding how people think, with LIWC2015 yielding the strongest, most parsimonious results. Open- vocabulary approaches reveal more specific and concrete patterns across a broad range of content domains, better address ambiguous word senses, and are less prone to misinterpretation, suggesting that they are well-suited for capturing the nuances of everyday psychological processes. We detail several errors that can occur in closed-vocabulary analyses, the impact of sample size, number of words per user and number of topics included in open-vocabulary analyses, and implications of different analytical decisions. We conclude with recommendations for researchers, advocating for a complementary approach that combines closed- and open-vocabulary methods. Translational Abstract A considerable amount of text data exists online that capture people's everyday thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Technological advances now make it possible to analyze such data efficiently and at large scale, providing insights into everyday psychological processes as they occur in the real world. To provide guidance on best practice approaches for using such data effectively, this synthesis reviews and quantitively compares the main closed-vocabulary approaches (theoretically derived lists of words from the social sciences) and open-vocabulary approaches (data-driven techniques from computer science that explore many words, phrases, and topics) for automated text analysis. We find that the different methods are complementary; closed-vocabulary approaches provide a way to study the fundamental patterns of how people think and feel, whereas open-vocabulary approaches best elucidate what people think and feel.","[Eichstaedt, Johannes C.] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Jane Stanford Way,Bldg 420, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Eichstaedt, Johannes C.] Stanford Univ, Inst Human Ctr AI, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Kern, Margaret L.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Grad Sch Educ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Yaden, David B.] Johns Hopkins Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Baltimore, MD USA; [Schwartz, H.

For these reasons, companies have to deal with the compatibility between the productive activity and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Under this context, this paper aims to examine CSR communication in the mining sector on Twitter and identify the main topics of CSR and the main participants in the creation of content. A software framework has been developed in order to manage big text data in the study of CSR and sentiment computational content analysis to classify the tweets as positive, negative or neutral. Twitter was chosen since it is one of the three most commonly used social network sites by mining companies for information sharing and stakeholder engagement. The data collection period was from February 2019 to December 2019 and it resulted in 2,000,000 Twitter posts. The results show the CSR debate is increasingly growing in developing countries and in countries with a bad reputation of environmental and health mining conditions. The debate is mainly centered on the impact of mining industries on the land, and many stakeholders advocate for more environmental responsibility since they consider that mining activities are still controversial. Also, results reveal that the mining sector should improve the CSR disclosure and adopt a stakeholder engagement strategy grounded in the corporate stakeholder relationship perspective, the two-way symmetrical communication, and the dialogic theory of public relations. Social network sites such as Twitter can lead to positive outcomes for companies since they are not only a way to advertise what the company does with regards to CSR, but also to receive input from other for their CSR activities.","[Vilaplan, Jordi] Univ Lleida, Dept Comp Sci, Av Jaume II 69, Lleida 25001, Spain; [Pons, Adria; Vintro, Carla; Rius, Josep] Univ Lleida, Dept Business Adm, Av Jaume II 71, Lleida 25001, Spain",Universitat de Lleida; Universitat de Lleida,"Rius, J (通讯作者)，Univ Lleida, Dept Business Adm, Av Jaume II 71, Lleida 25001, Spain.",josep.riustorrento@udl.cat,"Vilaplana, Jordi/G-6766-2012","Vilaplana, Jordi/0000-0002-8188-4914","Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [TIN2017-84553-C2-2-R, 2017-SGR363]; Generalitat de CatalunyaGeneralitat de CatalunyaGeneral Electric","This work was supported by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad under contract TIN2017-84553-C2-2-R.

A computerized textual analysis of over 1,000 socially transmitted NYT stories regarding both candidates was performed.

The mechanism of social interaction remains inadequately understood. Previous studies have investigated the consequences of communication under a one-way information transmission mechanism from more-informed leaders to less-informed followers. This mechanism leads to the boomerang effect-a reduction in leaders' forecasting efficiency due to the information transmission. However, communication should be interactive. This paper devises a two-stage interactive cobweb model with a generalized information diffusion process called the bi-directional information diffusion (BID) process, which allows both information transmission and feedback mechanisms. Numerical analysis and simulations show that the model has multiple equilibria and can be dynamically stable under certain conditions. More importantly, the BID process improves forecast efficiency for all individuals, and the boomerang effect disappears if leaders correctly observe followers' forecasts to revise their expectations.","[Guse, Eran] Murray State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Arthur J Bauernfeind Coll Business, Murray, KY 42071 USA; [Wong, M.

Links generated between two social user nodes are influenced by not only the structural information of their social network nodes but also the users' occupational environments, interests in opinions, topics, social psychology, etc. In the existing studies of link prediction in complex networks, predicting the possibility of link generation between two nodes that have not yet generated edges in a complex network is calculated mainly from the known network nodes and structural information. Such studies, in which the main predictors are the structural similarities among social nodes or user location nodes, cannot fully explore and utilize the social network node users' public opinion characteristics. To quantitatively identify the influence of different dimensions of public opinion factors on predicting links between social user nodes, we present a study on the prediction of social network links in We the Media networks. Starting with the characteristics of the elements found in public opinions on We the Media networks, in which public opinions are multidimensional and multilayered and possess multiple attributes, we built a multidimensional network model oriented towards the topology of public opinions on We the Media networks. Combined with an analysis of the driving factors in the formation of user-node relationships in social networks, we designed a prediction algorithm that works on multidimensional network links. Furthermore, we conducted an empirical analysis of social relationship prediction, whose effectiveness has also been compared with baseline methods such as the Common-Neighbourhood-Driven model, the Jaccard index, and the SimRank method. We chose the area under the curve (AUC) as the indicator of link prediction and evaluation using We the Media public opinion data from Weibo.com. The research findings of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) The effectiveness of the multidimensional network link prediction algorithm is significantly higher than those of the baseline methods. (2) The prediction algorithm presented in this paper works on multidimensional network links and can evaluate the effects of different dimensions of public opinion factors on the prediction of user-node links in social networks. (3) The element of occupational environment improves the accuracy much more than the element of user interest in opinions and topics when predicting user-nodes' links, while the element of social psychology reduces the accuracy.","[Wang Guanghui; Li Jimei; Liu Kaidi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, 15 ZhongGuanCun BeiYiTiao, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang Guanghui] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies Nat & Social Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang Yufei] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Beijing 100876, Peoples R China; [Li Jimei] Beijing Municipal Inst Labour Protect, Beijing 100054, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications; Beijing Municipal Research Institute of Environment,"Wang, GH (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, 15 ZhongGuanCun BeiYiTiao, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",wangguanghui@casipm.ac.cn,,"Liu, Kai-Di/0000-0002-3499-2509","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71603250, 71974182]; Ministry of science and technology, ChinaMinistry of Science and Technology, China [2016YFC0503407]","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71603250;71974182), and the projects of Ministry of science and technology, China(2016YFC0503407).",,54,0,0,14,16,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-7503,1877-7511,,J COMPUT SCI-NETH,J.

A cross-sectional survey design questionnaire gathering information on the use of and attitudes towards technology applications was sent to five East African universities, and six Chinese universities. Respectively, data from 305 and 268 faculty members were collected, and analyzed using Technology Acceptance Modeling (TAM) combined with empirical and computational statistics. The results analysis found that only 19% of East African faculties taught part or all of an online course as compared to 69% of Chinese faculties. East Africa faculties use western social media much more than China faculties. However, China faculties use local social media more often. Findings from the relationships' path analysis reveal that for East Africa, System is the only variable that establishes a significant relationship with Actual technology Use. Ease of Use is closely related to Perceived Value, while Perceived Value is significantly related to Attitude towards technology. For China, System is the only variable that establishes a significant relationship with the Actual technology Use. Moreover, we find a wider relationship allying System Use and Actual technology tools Use for Chinese faculties indicating that they have more ICT access opportunities, thus their experience of using technology tools is more than that of East African faculties.","[Munyengabe, Sylvestre; Mukamusoni, Dariya; Nshimiyimana, Justin] Kibogora Polytech, POB 50, Nyamasheke, Western Provinc, Rwanda; [Niyigena, Jean Pierre] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Shenzhen Inst Adv Technol, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, CAS; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Munyengabe, S (通讯作者)，Kibogora Polytech, POB 50, Nyamasheke, Western Provinc, Rwanda.",munyesylve@yahoo.fr; jeanpierre@siat.ac.cn; musoni.kega@gmail.com; juwerra@gmail.com,,"Munyengabe, Sylvestre/0000-0003-1247-8215",,,,51,0,0,4,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1042-1629,1556-6501,,ETR&D-EDUC TECH RES,ETR&D-Educ.

Opinion dynamics theory is a young interdisciplinary science that studies opinion formation in social networks and has huge potential in applications such as marketing, advertising, and recommendations. The term social influence refers to the behavioral change of individuals due to the interactions with others in a social system (for example, organizations, communities, and society in general). The advent of the Internet has made a huge volume of data easily available to measure social influence across large populations. The aim of this work is to qualitatively and quantitatively infer social influence from data, from a systems and control viewpoint. First, definitions and models of opinions dynamics are introduced, and structural constraints of online social networks are considered based on the notion of sparsity. Then, the main approaches to infer a network's structure from a set of observed data are reviewed. Finally, algorithms that exploit the introduced models and structural constraints are presented, focusing on sample complexity and computational requirements.","[Ravazzi, Chiara] MIT, Lab Informat & Decis Syst, Cambridge, England; [Dabbene, Fabrizio] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Dabbene, Fabrizio] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Dabbene, Fabrizio] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Control Sci, Moscow, Russia; [Lagoa, Constantino M.] Penn State Univ, Dept Elect Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Proskurnikov, Anton V.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Problems Mech Engn, St Petersburg, Russia","University of Iowa; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Russian Academy of Sciences; V.A.

To test our argument, we analyze the case of the 2017 legislative elections in Chile. We combine an analysis of Facebook and online electoral campaign data from 80 congressional campaigns that competed in three districts with ethnographic sources (i.e., campaigns observed on the ground and in-depth interviews with candidates).

A large body of research focuses on developing generally applicable heuristics for more effective headline writing. In this work, we measure the importance of a number of theoretically motivated textual features to headline performance. Using a corpus of hundreds of thousands of headline A/B tests run by hundreds of news publishers, we develop and evaluate a machine-learned model to predict headline testing outcomes. We find that the model exhibits modest performance above baseline and further estimate an empirical upper bound for such content-based prediction in this domain, indicating an important role for non-content-based factors in test outcomes. Together, these results suggest that any particular headline writing approach has only a marginal impact, and that understanding reader behavior and headline context are key to predicting news attention decisions.","[Hagar, Nick; Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [DeWilde, Burton] Chartbeat Inc, New York, NY USA",Northwestern University,"Diakopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",nad@northwestern.edu,,,National Science Foundation GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IIS-1717330],"This work is supported by the National Science Foundation Grant, award IIS-1717330.",,69,0,0,5,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

There exists a natural and imminent need for creating human-centered media analytics to illuminate the stories being told and to understand their impact on individuals and society at large. An objective understanding of media content has numerous applications for different stakeholders, from creators to decision-/policy-makers to consumers. Advances in multimodal signal processing and machine learning (ML) can enable detailed and nuanced characterization of media content (of who, what, how, where, and why) at scale. They can also aid our understanding of the impact of media on a range of issues, including individual experiences, behavioral, cultural, and societal trends, and commercial outcomes. Modern deep learning models combined with audiovisual signal processing can analyze entertainment media, such as Film & TV content to quantify gender, age, and race representations. This creates awareness in an objective way that was hitherto impossible. On the other hand, text mining and natural language processing allow nuanced understanding of language use and spoken interactions in media, such as News to track patterns and trends across different contexts. Moreover, advances in human sensing have enabled us to directly measure the influence of media on an individual's physiology (and brain), while social media analysis enables tracking the societal impact of media content on different cross sections of the society.

This high level of toxic content prevents the dissemination of important and time-sensitive information and jeopardizes the sense of community that online social networks (OSNs) seek to cultivate. In this article, we present techniques to analyze toxic content and actors that propagated it on YouTube during the initial months after COVID-19 information was made public. Our dataset consists of 544 channels, 3,488 videos, 453,111 commenters, and 849,689 comments. We applied topic modeling based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify dominant topics and evolving trends within the comments on relevant videos. We conducted social network analysis (SNA) to detect influential commenters, and toxicity analysis to measure the health of the network. SNA allows us to identify the top toxic users in the network, which led to the creation of experiments simulating the impact of removal of these users on toxicity in the network. Through this work, we demonstrate not only how to identify toxic content related to COVID-19 on YouTube and the actors who propagated this toxicity, but also how social media companies and policy makers can use this work. This work is novel in that we devised a set of experiments in an attempt to show how if social media platforms eliminate certain toxic users, they can improve the overall health of the network by reducing the overall toxicity level.","[Obadimu, Adewale] LinkedIn Corp, Little Rock, AR USA; [Khaund, Tuja; Mead, Esther; Marcoux, Thomas; Agarwal, Nitin] Univ Arkansas, Dept Informat Sci, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Agarwal, N (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Informat Sci, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.",nxagarwal@ualr.edu,"Mead, Esther/AFQ-6652-2022",,"U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OIA-1946391, OIA-1920920, IIS-1636933, ACI-1429160, IIS-1110868]; U.S. Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-10-1-0091, N00014-14-1-0489, N00014-15-P-1187, N00014-16-1-2016, N00014-16-1-2412, N00014-17-1-2675, N00014-17-1-2605, N68335-19-C-0359, N00014-19-1-2336, N68335-20-C-0540, N00014-21-1-2121]; U.S. Army Research Office [W911NF-20-1-0262, W911NF-16-1-0189]; U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyUnited States Department of DefenseDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) [W31P4Q-17-C-0059]; Arkansas Research Alliance; Jerry L.

The study focuses on three research questions: When did reference to scientific methods peak, which aspects of nature of science (NOS) do these tweets address, and the extent to which Twitter users' sentiments provide useful information about their attitudes towards the scientific method. COVID-19 tweets were mined and queried using scientific method(s) as a keyword. A content analysis using the Family Resemblance Approach (FRA) to NOS and a non-computational sentiment analysis were conducted on the obtained data set. The findings revealed that tweets using science method(s) peaked most during the months of April and May, as more information was being communicated about promising treatments and vaccine development. Most tweets were assigned multiple FRA categories. The sentiment analysis revealed that attitude towards the scientific method was predominantly supportive. Discussion of three events that were observed in clusters of tweets provided additional context. The paper concludes by noting the methodological affordances and limitations of applying the FRA for identifying NOS-related content in Twitter environments and underscoring the potential of targeted NOS messaging in promoting informed discussions about NOS in the public sphere.","[Bichara, David B.] Univ Delaware, Dept Biomed Engn, Newark, DE USA; [Dagher, Zoubeida R.] Univ Delaware, Sch Educ, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Fang, Hui] Univ Delaware, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Newark, DE USA",University of Delaware; University of Delaware; University of Delaware,"Dagher, ZR (通讯作者)，Univ Delaware, Sch Educ, Newark, DE 19716 USA.",zoubeida@udel.edu,"Dagher, Zoubeida R./AAD-1314-2022",,,,,64,0,0,4,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0926-7220,1573-1901,,SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS,Sci.

Attitudes, norms, institutions, behavior, and cultural products shift over time, sometimes with dizzying speed. However psychological science has either largely ignored cultural change or tacitly treated it as a source of noise. These changes in fact have important implications not only for psychological theory and research, but also policy, public health, and daily life. The present special issue draws together cutting-edge research and theory that addresses what one might think of as the What, the Why, and the How of cultural change. The articles encompass a range of theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches and focus on a diverse set of phenomena and processes ranging from personality to prejudice, to collective memory. Here we provide a brief overview and introduction, laying out our hopes to encourage more psychologists to consider cultural change in their own research and to join us in the emerging field of cultural dynamics.","[Varnum, Michael E.

Addressing the importance of message sources, this study aims to (1) compare audience reactions toward BLM content posted by brands and by influencers with brand sponsorship and (2) apply computational methods in influencer marketing to examine a large volume of social media texts qualitatively and quantitatively. A total of 32,702 comments on 110 Instagram posts on BLM were collected and analyzed through both human efforts and machine-learning algorithms. As a result, we found that black-influencer-created BLM attracted higher consumer engagement than posts by nonblack influencers and brands. Moreover, we generated seven different themes among which brands received the highest percentages of criticism, demands for more proactive actions, and purchase/boycott intentions. Influencers had more comments that reflected personal stories and emotion regarding BLM. Black influencers in particular received the highest percentage of praise and appreciation. Finally, comments on brands' BLM posts embedded the highest proportion of negative sentiment, while those of black influencers' posts were predominantly positive. Therefore, the comparisons of BLM sources elucidate the promising potential of influencers in communicating corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages of racial equality-a topic which engenders high relevance to every individual in our society.","[Yang, Jeongwon; Chuenterawong, Ploypin] Syracuse Univ, SI Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, Syracuse, NY 13202 USA; [Pugdeethosapol, Krittaphat] Syracuse Univ, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Syracuse, NY 13202 USA",Syracuse University; Syracuse University,"Yang, J (通讯作者)，Syracuse Univ, Newhouse Sch Publ Commun, 300 E Washington St, Syracuse, NY 13202 USA.",jyang97@syr.edu,"Pugdeethosapol, Krittaphat/AAA-4392-2022",,,,,104,1,1,9,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-3367,1557-7805,,J ADVERTISING,J.

While these systems are becoming more and more important in the growth of social media, they tend to increase the popularity of users that are already popular. Indeed, since link recommenders aim to predict user behavior, they accelerate the creation of links that are likely to be created in the future and, consequently, reinforce social bias by suggesting few (popular) users, giving few chances to most users to create new connections and increase their popularity. In this article, we measure the popularity of a user by means of her social influence, which is her capability to influence other users' opinions, and we propose a link recommendation algorithm that evaluates the links to suggest according to their increment in social influence instead of their likelihood of being created. In detail, we give a 1 - epsilon factor approximation algorithm for the problem of maximizing the social influence of a given set of target users by suggesting a fixed number of new connections considering the Linear Threshold model as model for diffusion. We experimentally show that, with few new links and small computational time, our algorithm is able to increase by far the social influence of the target users. We compare our algorithm with several baselines and show that it is the most effective one in terms of increased influence.","[Coro, Federico] Sapienza Univ Rome, Comp Sci Dept, Rome, Italy; [D'angelo, Gianlorenzo] Gran Sasso Sci Inst, Laquila, Italy; [Velaj, Yllka] Univ Vienna, Vienna, Austria",Sapienza University Rome; Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI); University of Vienna,"Coro, F (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Comp Sci Dept, Rome, Italy.",erico.coro@uniroma1.it; gianlorenzo.dangelo@gssi.it; yllka.velaj@univie.ac.at,,"Coro, Federico/0000-0002-7321-3467","Italian MIUR PRIN 2017 Project ALGADIMAR Algorithms, Games, and Digital Markets","This work has been partially supported by the Italian MIUR PRIN 2017 Project ALGADIMAR Algorithms, Games, and Digital Markets.",,51,0,0,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",1556-4681,1556-472X,,ACM T KNOWL DISCOV D,ACM Trans.

During the event, a large number of users participated in the discussion about GameStop and coordinated trading behavior on r/WSB to push the stock price higher. In this article, we investigate the characteristics of the collective behaviors and social dynamics from the evolutions of topological structure, discussed topics, and user sentiment polarity (SP) by constructing dynamic interaction networks, modeling the topic, and analyzing the user sentiment. We find that the topological structure of the interaction network evolves toward a more efficient direction, the discussed topics change more centralized, and the user sentiment tends to be more positive and divergent. And we reveal that part of GameStop's stock price is explained by the social media activity, popularity of the dominant topic, topic cohesiveness, SP of users, and sentiment divergence between interacted users on r/WSB. Our work quantitatively characterizes the interaction networks and user behavior during the GameStop short squeeze and provides an example to analyze the event which synchronously evolves in the physical space and cyberspace.

It is also a major reason for suicide, especially among teenagers. In the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the affected countries have recommended social distancing and lockdown measures. Resulting in interpersonal isolation, these measures have raised serious concerns for mental health and depression. Generally, clinical psychologists diagnose depressed people via face-to-face interviews following the clinical depression criteria. However, often patients tend to not consult doctors in their early stages of depression. Nowadays, people are increasingly using social media to express their moods. In this article, we aim to predict depressed users as well as estimate their depression intensity via leveraging social media (Twitter) data, in order to aid in raising an alarm. We model this problem as a supervised learning task. We start with weakly labeling the Twitter data in a self-supervised manner. A rich set of features, including emotional, topical, behavioral, user level, and depression-related $n$ -gram features, are extracted to represent each user. Using these features, we train a small long short-term memory (LSTM) network using Swish as an activation function, to predict the depression intensities. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We outperform the baseline models for depression intensity estimation by achieving the lowest mean squared error of 1.42 and also outperform the existing state-of-the-art binary classification method by more than 2% of accuracy. We found that the depressed users frequently use negative words such as stress and sad, mostly post during late nights, highly use personal pronouns and sometimes also share personal events.","[Ghosh, Shreya] IIT Ropar, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Rupnagar 140001, India; [Ghosh, Shreya] Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Melbourne, Vic 3168, Australia; [Anwar, Tarique] Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Anwar, Tarique] CSIROs Data61, Eveleigh, NSW 2122, Australia",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Ropar; Monash University; Macquarie University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Anwar, T (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Comp, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.; Anwar, T (通讯作者)，CSIROs Data61, Eveleigh, NSW 2122, Australia.",shreya.ghosh@monash.edu; tarique.anwar@mq.edu.au,,"Anwar, Tarique/0000-0001-7157-0236; Ghosh, Shreya/0000-0002-2639-8374",,,,53,0,0,10,10,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2329-924X,,,IEEE T COMPUT SOC SY,IEEE Trans.

We use text analyses to characterize the frequency, toxicity, and tone of comments in the chat. Our experimental findings indicate that Democratic subjects assigned to the Facebook (social) chat condition reported lower affect toward Democrats and a worse viewing experience, aligned with the toxic and overwhelming nature of the chat. The polarity of candidate-directed comments also influenced candidate evaluations and perceived performance in the polls.

Research has proven that the amount of hateful messages increases inevitably on online social media. Although hate propagators constitute a tiny minority-with less than 1% participants-they create an unproportionally high amount of hate motivated content. Thus, if not countered properly, hate speech can propagate through the whole society. In this paper we apply agent-based modelling to reproduce how the hate speech phenomenon spreads within social networks. We reuse insights from the research literature to construct and validate a baseline model for the propagation of hate speech. From this, three countermeasures are modelled and simulated to investigate their effectiveness in containing the spread of hatred: Education, deferring hateful content, and cyber activism. Our simulations suggest that: (1) Education consititutes a very successful countermeasure, but it is long term and still cannot eliminate hatred completely; (2) Deferring hateful content has a similar-although lower-positive effect than education, and it has the advantage of being a short-term countermeasure; (3) In our simulations, extreme cyber activism against hatred shows the poorest performance as a countermeasure, since it seems to increase the likelihood of resulting in highly polarised societies.","[Lopez-Sanchez, Maite] Univ Barcelona, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Barcelona 08007, Spain; [Mueller, Arthur] Univ Bundeswehr Munich, Inst Polit Sci, D-85579 Neubiberg, Germany",University of Barcelona; Bundeswehr University Munich,"Lopez-Sanchez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Barcelona 08007, Spain.",maite_lopez@ub.edu; arthur.mueller@unibw.de,"Lopez-Sanchez, Maite/ABG-2682-2021","Lopez-Sanchez, Maite/0000-0002-1838-5928","Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) from the Generalitat de Catalunya [2017 SGR]; MISMIS (Desinformacion y agresividad en Social Media: Analizando el lenguaje) Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades [PGC2018-096212-B-C33]; Crowd4SDG (Citizen Science for Monitoring Climate Impacts and Achieving Climate Resilience) from the European Union [H2020-872944]; CI-SUSTAIN (Advanced Computational Intelligence Techniques for Reaching) from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [PID2019-104156GB-I00]; COREDEM (The Influence of Complex Reward Computation and Working Memory Load onto Decision-Making: A combined Theoretical, Human and Non-human primate approach within the Human Brain Project) from the European Union [SGA2H2020-785907]; nanoMOOC (Nou format audiovisual amb funcionalitats tecnologiques avancades per a l'aprenentatge) from Agencia de Suport a l'Empresa Catalana","This research was funded by projects: 2017 SGR code 341 from the Agencia de Gestio d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (AGAUR) from the Generalitat de Catalunya; MISMIS (Desinformacion y agresividad en Social Media: Analizando el lenguaje, code PGC2018-096212-B-C33) from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovacion y Universidades; Crowd4SDG (Citizen Science for Monitoring Climate Impacts and Achieving Climate Resilience, code H2020-872944) from the European Union; CI-SUSTAIN (Advanced Computational Intelligence Techniques for Reaching, code PID2019-104156GB-I00) from the Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion; COREDEM (The Influence of Complex Reward Computation and Working Memory Load onto Decision-Making: A combined Theoretical, Human and Non-human primate approach code SGA2H2020-785907 within the Human Brain Project) from the European Union; and nanoMOOC (Nou format audiovisual amb funcionalitats tecnologiques avancades per a l'aprenentatge code COMRDI18-1-0010-02) from Agencia de Suport a l'Empresa Catalana.",,51,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

Here, we use Twitter as a distributed news and opinion aggregation source to identify and track the dynamics of the dominant day-scale stories around Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States. Working with a data set comprising around 20 billion 1-grams, we first compare each day's 1-gram and 2-gram usage frequencies to those of a year before, to create day- and week-scale timelines for Trump stories for 2016-2021. We measure Trump's narrative control, the extent to which stories have been about Trump or put forward by Trump. We then quantify story turbulence and collective chronopathy-the rate at which a population's stories for a subject seem to change over time. We show that 2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation slowed dramatically during the first two major waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, with rapid turnover returning first with the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's murder and then later by events leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, including the storming of the US Capitol six days into 2021. Trump story turnover for 2 months during the COVID-19 pandemic was on par with that of 3 days in September 2017.

This is especially relevant in decision-making - the process of selecting an alternative from a set of possible options -, that is commonly based on personal opinions which may evolve along time. In this work, we present a model of opinion dynamics where opinions are represented using fuzzy linguistic 2-tuples, a realistic representation of imprecise information. In our framework, the propagation of opinions in the communication is divided into three independent sub-processes. Additionally, we use a social network to represent agents' interactions and an awareness deactivation mechanism to model the awareness dynamics in the system (i.e., options for which agents have opinions). Our opinion dynamics model can be easily integrated into an agent-based system to how opinions spread and evolve.

This paper explores how public opinions might differ between survey and social media platforms in terms of content and audience, focusing on the test case of opinions about autonomous vehicles. The paper first extends previous overviews comparing surveys and social media as measurement tools to include a broader range of survey types, including surveys that result from public deliberation, considering the dialogic characteristics of different social media, and the range of issue publics and marginalized voices that different surveys and social media forums can attract. It then compares findings and implications from analyses of public opinion about autonomous vehicles from traditional surveys, results of public deliberation, and analyses of Reddit posts, applying a newly developed computational text analysis tool. Findings demonstrate that social media analyses can both help researchers learn more about issues that are uncovered by surveys and also uncover opinions from subpopulations with specialized knowledge and unique orientations toward a subject. In light of these findings, we point to future directions on how researchers and policymakers can synthesize survey and social media data, and the corresponding data integration techniques, to study public opinion.","[Chen, Kaiping] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 316 Hiram Smith Hall,1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Tomblin, David] Univ Maryland, Sci Technol & Soc Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Chen, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Life Sci Commun, 316 Hiram Smith Hall,1545 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",kchen67@wisc.edu,"Chen, Kaiping/AAD-7014-2022","Chen, Kaiping/0000-0002-5864-5333",Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,"KAIPING CHEN is an assistant professor in the Department of Life Sciences Communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.

Data consist of 133,079 original Sina Weibo posts dealing with the novel coronavirus. The relative prevalence of eight different emotion groups is traced longitudinally using the ROST Content Mining System and the Emotion Vocabulary of Dalian University of Technology. The study finds a progression from confusion/fear, to disappointment/frustration, to depression/anxiety, then finally to happiness/gratitude.

Drawing on the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this study investigates how three types of peripheral cues-content richness, emotional valence, and communication topic-are associated with COVID-19 information sharing on Twitter. We used computational methods, combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling with psycholinguistic indicators obtained from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count dictionary to measure these concepts and built a research model to assess their effects on information sharing. Results showed that content richness was negatively associated with information sharing. Tweets with negative emotions received more user engagement, whereas tweets with positive emotions were less likely to be disseminated. Further, tweets mentioning advisories tended to receive more retweets than those mentioning support and news updates. More importantly, emotional valence moderated the relationship between communication topics and information sharing-tweets discussing news updates and support conveying positive sentiments led to more information sharing; tweets mentioning the impact of COVID-19 with negative emotions triggered more sharing. Finally, theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed in the context of global public health communication.","[Zheng, Han; Goh, Dion Hoe-Lian; Lee, Edmund Wei Jian; Lee, Chei Sian; Theng, Yin-Leng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,05-10, Singapore 637718, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Zheng, H (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, 31 Nanyang Link,05-10, Singapore 637718, Singapore.",han019@e.ntu.edu.sg,,"ZHENG, HAN/0000-0003-4032-4299",,,,64,0,0,30,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2330-1635,2330-1643,,J ASSOC INF SCI TECH,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/asi.24587,,Oct-21,16,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science",,Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,WH0NT,WOS:000707386600001,34901313,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2022/4/10,

Using original data on the German Federal Constitutional Court, the study analyzes when court press releases are reported on in the media. Certain news values (e.g., conflict, political power, continuity/familiarity) are assumed to increase the probability that a press release will be reported on in the news. By using an automated content analysis approach, this study assesses whether 584 press releases were reported on in German newspapers over a period of eight years (2010-2018). Only press releases that promote decisions are used as they are the official information subsidies that the Court disseminates to the public through the media. Findings indicate that only 18% of press releases are reported on in the news. Furthermore, the news values of conflict and political power are found to have no influence on the success of a press release, while press releases that promote decisions with an oral hearing are more likely to be picked up by journalists. Hence, issues that are familiar to the public are more likely to be covered.","[Meyer, Philipp] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Hannover, Germany",University of Hannover,"Meyer, P (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Polit Sci, Hannover, Germany.",p.meyer@ipw.uni-hannover.de,"Meyer, Philipp/AAV-7313-2020","Meyer, Philipp/0000-0002-7986-9432",,,,55,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

Building on the work of James Bryce, Lindsay Rogers, Herbert Blumer, Paul Lazarsfeld, and more, this essay revisits the discipline's historical roots and draws parallels between past theory and present practice. Today, scholars treat public opinion as the summation of individual attitudes, weighted equally and expressed anonymously at static points in time through polls, yet prior to the advent of survey research, it was conceived as something intrinsically social and dynamic. In an era dominated by online discussion boards and social media platforms, the insights of this earlier classical tradition offer two pathways forward. First, for those who criticize computational social science as poorly theorized, it provides a strong justification for the work that data scientists do in text mining and sentiment analysis. And second, it offers clues for how emerging technologies might be leveraged effectively for the study of public opinion in the future.","[Guber, Deborah Lynn] Univ Vermont, Dept Polit Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Guber, DL (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Room 532,94 Univ Pl, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",Deborah.Guber@uvm.edu,,,,,,157,0,0,3,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

In this study, the effectiveness and cost of digital contact tracing (DCT) technology-based on-campus mitigation strategy are studied through epidemic simulations using high-resolution empirical contact networks of teachers and students. Compared with traditional class, grade, and school closure strategies, the DCT-based strategy offers a practical yet much more efficient way of mitigating COVID-19 spreading in the crowded campus. Specifically, the strategy based on DCT can achieve the same level of disease control as rigid school suspensions but with significantly fewer students quarantined. We further explore the necessary conditions to ensure the effectiveness of DCT-based strategy and auxiliary strategies to enhance mitigation effectiveness and make the following recommendation: social distancing should be implemented along with DCT, the adoption rate of DCT devices should be assured, and swift virus tests should be carried out to discover asymptomatic infections and stop their subsequent transmissions. We also argue that primary schools have higher disease transmission risks than high schools and, thereby, should be alerted when considering reopenings.","[Sun, Hao-Chen; Xu, Xiao-Ke] Dalian Minzu Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiao-Fan] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Web Min Lab, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhan-Wei] Univ Hong Kong, LKS Fac Med, Sch Publ Hlth, WHO Collaborating Ctr Infect Dis Epidemiol & Cont, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Du, Zhan-Wei] Hong Kong Sci & Technol Pk, Lab Data Discovery Hlth, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ye] Beijing Normal Univ, Computat Commun Res Ctr, Zhuhai 519087, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ye] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Dalian Minzu University; City University of Hong Kong; University of Hong Kong; World Health Organization; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University,"Xu, XK (通讯作者)，Dalian Minzu Univ, Coll Informat & Commun Engn, Dalian 116600, Peoples R China.; Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Computat Commun Res Ctr, Zhuhai 519087, Peoples R China.; Wu, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",2332697351@qq.com; xf.liu@cityu.edu.hk; duzhanwei0@gmail.com; xuxiaoke@foxmail.com; yewu@bnu.edu.cn,"Liu, Xiao Fan/I-6403-2015; xu, xiaoke/G-5418-2011","Liu, Xiao Fan/0000-0001-8342-4623; xu, xiaoke/0000-0002-9148-3145; Sun, HaoChen/0000-0001-8282-3972","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61773091, 11875005, 61976025, 11975025]; Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program [XLYC1807106]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [2020-MZLH-22]; Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China [19ZDA324]","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61773091, Grant 11875005, Grant 61976025, and Grant 11975025; in part by the Liaoning Revitalization Talents Program under Grant XLYC1807106; in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province, China under Grant 2020-MZLH-22; and in part by the Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China under Grant 19ZDA324.

Such study has traditionally practised through content analysis and/or discourse analysis manually, which is prone to subjective interpretation. Thus, this study implemented automated analysis to objectively select and interpret a big data. A total of 8,890 online newspaper articles that were published from 1990 to April 2019 were collected through automated parsing. The entire period and decade-phase based keyword and keyword network analysis were practised in order to determine how the social perceptions and related issues had changed over time. The results indicated that there was a rapid growth in scope of articles on students with IDs over the past 30 years. The attention of media gradually expanded from special education to improving quality of lives of students with IDs and their families. Moreover, online newspaper articles seemed to focus on social controversies and incidents such as sexual assaults that are related to students with IDs.

This article addresses the global threat of the anticipated overlap of COVID-19 with seasonal-influenza. Objectives: Scientific evidence based on simulation methodology is presented to reveal the impact of a dual outbreak, with scenarios intended for propagation analysis. This article aims at researchers, clinicians of family medicine, general practice and policy-makers worldwide. The implications for the clinical practice of primary health care are discussed. Current research is an effort to explore new directions in epidemiology and health services delivery. Methods: Projections consisted of machine learning, dynamic modelling algorithms and whole simulations. Input data consisted of global indicators of infectious diseases. Four simulations were run for '20% versus 60% flu-vaccinated populations' and '10 versus 20 personal contacts'. Outputs consisted of numerical values and mathematical graphs. Outputs consisted of numbers for 'never infected', 'vaccinated', 'infected/recovered', 'symptomatic/asymptomatic' and 'deceased' individuals. Peaks, percentages, R-0, durations are reported. Results: The best-case scenario was one with a higher flu-vaccination rate and fewer contacts. The reverse generated the worst outcomes, likely to disrupt the provision of vital community services. Both measures were proven effective; however, results demonstrated that 'increasing flu-vaccination rates' is a more powerful strategy than 'limiting social contacts'. Conclusions: Results support two affordable preventive measures: (i) to globally increase influenza-vaccination rates, (ii) to limit the number of personal contacts during outbreaks. The authors endorse changing practices and research incentives towards multidisciplinary collaborations. The urgency of the situation is a call for international health policy to promote interdisciplinary modern technologies in public health engineering.","[Tunaligil, Verda] TR MoH Hlth Directorate Istanbul, SIMMERK Med Simulat Ctr, Div Publ Hlth, TR-34330 Istanbul, Turkey; [Tunaligil, Verda] TR MoH Hlth Directorate Istanbul, Dept Emergency, Disaster Med Serv, TR-34330 Istanbul, Turkey; [Meral, Gulsen] Nutrigenet & Epigenet Assoc, Presidents Off, Istanbul, Turkey; [Meral, Gulsen] Nutrigenet & Epigenet Assoc, Dept Pediat, Istanbul, Turkey; [Dabak, Mustafa Resat] TR MoH Haseki Res & Training Hosp, Dept Family Med, Div Residency, Training Programs & Clin Practice Chieftaincy, Istanbul, Turkey; [Canbulat, Mehmet] Turkish Airlines, Dept Data Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Canbulat, Mehmet] Robert Koch Inst, Dept Data Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Demir, Siddika Semahat] Sci Heroes Assoc, Presidents Off, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demir, Siddika Semahat] Sci Heroes Assoc, Dept Biomed, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demir, Siddika Semahat] Sci Heroes Assoc, Dept Elect, Istanbul, Turkey; [Demir, Siddika Semahat] Sci Heroes Assoc, Dept Comp Engn, Istanbul, Turkey",Turkish Airlines; Robert Koch Institute,"Tunaligil, V (通讯作者)，TR MoH Hlth Directorate Istanbul, SIMMERK Med Simulat Ctr, Div Publ Hlth, TR-34330 Istanbul, Turkey.; Tunaligil, V (通讯作者)，TR MoH Hlth Directorate Istanbul, Dept Emergency, Disaster Med Serv, TR-34330 Istanbul, Turkey.",verda@post.harvard.edu,,"Canbulat, Mehmet/0000-0002-3332-7304; Tunaligil (MD, MPH, PhD), Dr. Verda/0000-0002-4965-9231",,,,33,0,0,2,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0263-2136,1460-2229,,FAM PRACT,Fam.

We find first that meat consumption and dietary options became one of the most discussed issues on Twitter in response to the IPCC report, even though it was a relatively minor element of the report; second, this new issue of controversy (meat and diet) had similar, high levels of toxicity to strongly contentious issues in previous IPCC reports (skepticism about climate science and the credibility of the IPCC). We suggest that this is in part a reflection of increasingly polarized narratives about meat and diet found in other areas of public discussion and of a movement away from criticism of climate science towards criticism of climate solutions. Finally, we discuss the possible implications of these findings for the work of the IPCC in anticipating responses to its reports and responding to them effectively.","[Sanford, Mary] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England; [Painter, James] Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England; [Painter, James; Lorimer, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England; [Yasseri, Taha] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Sociol, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Yasseri, Taha] Univ Coll Dublin, Geary Inst Publ Policy, Dublin 4, Ireland",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Painter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Reuters Inst Study Journalism, 13 Norham Gardens, Oxford OX2 6PS, England.; Painter, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, S Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3QY, England.",james.painter@politics.ox.ac.uk,,"Yasseri, Taha/0000-0002-1800-6094","Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission; Our Planet Our Health (Livestock, Environment and People - LEAP) [205212/Z/16/Z]; Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N510129/1]","The research by yMary Sanford, James Painter, and Jamie Lorimer was funded by the Wellcome Trust, Our Planet Our Health (Livestock, Environment and People -LEAP) award number 205212/Z/16/Z.

Furthermore, we find that the degree of responsiveness to pandemic indicators differs significantly across political parties, with Republicans exhibiting weaker responses, on average.

This is due to the propagation effect of the initial removal. In the literature, this phenomenon is called cascading failure. In the context of trust modeling, cascading failure occurs when a node's trust toward another, changes to distrust resulting in the removal of the trust link between them. This change in the trust network may affect the other nodes' trust toward the target node. As the number of failures in a network increases, the users become more reluctant to share their interests and opinions with other members. Hence, it is important to model, detect and mitigate the cascading trust failures. Currently, simple computational trust models are used for modeling cascading trust failures in the existing works. The effect of relevant contexts in modeling cascading trust failures is still a missing concept in the proposed models. Failure in a specific trust context may impact the relevant contexts as well and may have less or no impact on the irrelevant contexts. Therefore, the need for a more comprehensive trust modeling approach for cascading trust failures is evident. In this paper, the proposed computational trust is formulated by considering the context dependencies in addition to the impact of trust contexts on one another. Also, by mapping the trust contexts to a multiplex network's layers and using the advantages of complex network analysis concepts, a new method for computing the similarity between the trust contexts is introduced. The introduced trust model uses the trust information of all layers (i.e., contexts) to compute the new trust values after a trust failure. In addition, the trust model uses the newly provided information to adjust the calculated trust values by leveraging real-world data. Besides, a model for trust cascading failure as well as an attack prevention method are introduced. By performing a wide range of experiments, including sensitivity analysis, accuracy analysis, and comparative studies, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated. Real-world networks' data such as Facebook and Twitter's ego nets and synthetic data are used for the performed evaluations. It is shown that higher values for the context's importance parameters make the trust links more vulnerable and easier to fail. The three well-known trust attack scenarios including HT, LT, and RT are performed and it is demonstrated that the layers with high similarity values tend to have more similar cascading failure patterns. It is shown that the accuracy of the introduced model for trust cascading failures is higher compared to the existing works. By adding the attack prevention component, the model's accuracy gets close to 1 in best cases, which is a notable improvement.","[Hanaforoosh, Mahrad; Azgomi, Mohammad Abdollahi] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Trustworthy Comp Lab, Tehran, Iran; [Ashtiani, Mehrdad] Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Social Comp Lab, Tehran, Iran",Iran University Science & Technology; Iran University Science & Technology,"Ashtiani, M (通讯作者)，Iran Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Comp Engn, Hengam St,Resalat Sq, Tehran 1684613114, Iran.",m_hanaforoosh@comp.iust.ac.ir; m_ashtiani@iust.ac.ir; azgomi@iust.ac.ir,"Ashtiani, Mehrdad/S-9571-2018; Azgomi, Mohammad Abdollahi/D-3734-2009","Ashtiani, Mehrdad/0000-0002-4574-1545; Azgomi, Mohammad Abdollahi/0000-0002-9605-8412; Hanaforoosh, Mahrad/0000-0002-3877-9916",,,,32,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-7503,1877-7511,,J COMPUT SCI-NETH,J.

However, recent studies in network science pinpoint towards the importance of temporal characteristics in the diffusion of opinion. As such, we combine concepts of micro-scale opinion dynamics and temporal epidemics, and develop a novel macro-scale temporal attenuation (TA) model, which uses pre-election poll data to improve forecasting accuracy. Our hypothesis is that the timing of publicizing opinion polls plays a significant role in how opinion oscillates, especially right before elections. Thus, we define the momentum of opinion as a temporal function which bounces up when opinion is injected in a system of voters, and dampens down during states of relaxation. We validate TA on survey data from the US Presidential Elections between 1968 and 2016, and TA outperforms several statistical estimates, ARIMA models, as well as the best pollsters at their time, in 10 out of 13 presidential elections. We present two different implementations of the TA model, which accumulate an average forecasting error of 3.04 points over the 48-year period. Conversely, statistical methods accumulate 7.48 points error, and the best pollsters accumulate 3.64 points. Overall, TA offers increases of 23-37% in forecasting performance compared to the state of the art. We show that the effectiveness of TA does not drop when relatively few polls are available; moreover, with increasing availability of pre-election surveys, we believe that our TA model will become a reference alongside other modern election forecasting techniques.","[Topirceanu, Alexandru] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Timisoara, Romania",Polytechnic University of Timisoara,"Topirceanu, A (通讯作者)，Politehn Univ Timisoara, Dept Comp & Informat Technol, Timisoara, Romania.",alext@cs.upt.ro,"Topirceanu, Alexandru/AAK-6609-2020",,"Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation (UEFISCDI)Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI) [PN-III-P1-1.1-PD-2019-0379]","This study relies partially on data from survey (s) administered by the Understanding America Study, which is maintained by the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of Southern California.

This distribution, known as social signature, is assumed to be stable for each person. Availability of digital traces of human communication allows testing whether this assumption is true and whether it holds in specific channels of computer-mediated communication. In this paper, we investigate private messaging on a popular social networking website on a sample of 39 users and 8063 communication partners of those users over the period of 18 months. We find that this communication channel does not reduce cognitive costs as the overall number of users' active contacts, on average, is equivalent to the cognitive limit known as Dunbar's number. Confirming some previous research, we show that the volume of communication is unevenly distributed, related to emotional closeness, and that changes in this distribution (that is, the changes in social signature) over time within an individual are smaller than the distances between social signatures of different individuals. However, as an absolutely novel finding, we demonstrate that the changes within individuals are statistically significant, thus questioning the concept of social signature as a stable phenomenon.","[Koltsova, Olessia Y.; Mararitsa, Larisa, V; Terpilovskii, Maxim A.; Sinyavskaya, Yadviga E.] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Social & Cognit Informat, Sedova St 55-2,Room 216, St Petersburg 190008, Russia; [Mararitsa, Larisa, V] St Petersburg State Univ, Dept Social Psychol, 7-9 Univ Skaya Emb, St Petersburg 199034, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Saint Petersburg State University,"Sinyavskaya, YE (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Social & Cognit Informat, Sedova St 55-2,Room 216, St Petersburg 190008, Russia.",ekoltsova@hse.ru; larisamararitsa@mail.ru; maximtrp@gmail.com; ysinyawskaya@hse.ru,"Terpilowski, Maksim/T-2199-2019",,,,,68,1,1,3,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

By applying methods in the digital humanities such as social network analysis and geographical information systems, I argue that literary activities in the sisa were performed beyond the factional demarcations, and cultural leverage was determined by their positional advantage in the community structure, not imposed by the political dominance. The factional affiliations of the participants were not directly correlated with the formation of cultural identities. The poetry communities functioned as major loci of cultural textual networks in the late Choson Seoul. Paying no heed to hierarchical distinction, the participants enjoyed the convivial spontaneous environments and shared their literary works with one another. Focusing on the collaborative nature of the era, many modern scholars have examined the kinship, social classes, and political orientations of the community members; furthermore, some argue that those who belonged to influential political factions also exercised their cultural influence and set mainstream literary trends. My research differs from previous contributions in its emphasis on the relational community structure and the information flow. Measuring the homogeneity, centralities, and membership, I prove that the cultural practices were much more complicated beyond the social- political system, and explain how politically marginalized people were able to gain leverage in the cultural world.","[Yoo, Jamie Jungmin] Yonsei Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Yoo, JJ (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Inst Humanities, Seoul, South Korea.",crimsonyoo@post.harvard.edu,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean Government (MEST)Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government [NRF-2010-361-A00018]","The analytical methods in this study were developed in several classes I attended at Harvard University, including Professor Peter Marsden's Social Network Analysis, Professor Peter Bol's Computational Methods for Historical Analysis, and the GIS Summer Institute.

We develop a pipeline of interlocking computational tools to extract a representation of this reader-generated shared narrative model. Using a corpus of reviews of five popular novels, we discover readers' distillation of the novels' main storylines and their sequencing, as well as the readers' varying impressions of characters in the novel. In so doing, we make three important contributions to the study of infinite-vocabulary networks: (i) an automatically derived narrative network that includes meta-actants; (ii) a sequencing algorithm, REV2SEQ, that generates a consensus sequence of events based on partial trajectories aggregated from reviews, and (iii) an 'impressions' algorithm, SENT2IMP, that provides multi-modal insight into readers' opinions of characters.","[Holur, Pavan; Shahsavari, Shadi; Ebrahimzadeh, Ehsan; Roychowdhury, Vwani] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Tangherlini, Timothy R.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Scandinavian, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Holur, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",pholur@ucla.edu,,"HOLUR, PAVAN/0000-0002-8495-9416",,,,73,0,0,3,3,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

The proliferation of user-generated content through social networking sites can enhance the existing transportation system. This work adds to the existing research by proposing a novel system to assess transit rider's reviews on the quality of transport services using Twitter information. A novel framework of a multi-objective evolutionary approach with association rule mining is proposed for feature-based opinion analysis on social media transit reviews. Feature-based opinion analysis is performed in two steps such as feature extraction and opinion analysis. First, the corpus of association rules is generated with opinion analysis, morphological and syntactic analysis, and semantic representation. Then, multi-objective flower pollination, multi-objective gray wolf, multi-objective moth flame, and multi-objective cat swarm optimization are applied to discover high-quality association rules on the transit user's opinion. The experimental results indicate that multi-objective cat swarm optimization using association rule mining performs better in terms of confidence, coverage, the interestingness of the rules, computational time, mean average support, and mean average confidence than the other proposed as existing approaches. It is observed that MCSO-ARM achieved an improvement in the range of 0.21%-0.27% in terms of confidence, 0.10%-0.13% in coverage, 0.10%-0.25% in interestingness, the computational time of 27.5 s, mean average support value of 0.10%-0.30% and mean of 0.20%-0.30% compared to the existing MPSO-ARM and other proposed MGWO-ARM, MMFO-ARM, and MFPO-ARM approaches.","[Meesala, Shobha Rani] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India; [Subramanian, Sumathy] Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India",Vellore Institute of Technology; Vellore Institute of Technology,"Subramanian, S (通讯作者)，Vellore Inst Technol, Sch Informat Technol & Engn, Vellore 632014, Tamil Nadu, India.",meesalashobha@gmail.com; ssumathy@vit.ac.in,,"S, Sumathy/0000-0003-0733-6351",,,,41,0,0,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1532-0626,1532-0634,,CONCURR COMP-PRACT E,Concurr.

There have been suggestions that public discourse on informal caregiving dwells overwhelmingly on the outsize toll it takes on the health of caregivers. However, few studies have examined societal narratives on caregivers-a gap our study aims to fill. We leveraged an online media database of 12 billion words collated from over 30 million articles to explore societal narratives on caregivers in six Asian countries. Computational linguistics and statistical analysis were applied to study the content of narratives on caregivers. The prevalence of societal narratives on caregivers was highest in Singapore-five times higher than Sri Lanka, which evidenced the lowest prevalence. Findings reveal that the inadequacies of institutional care as well as the need to train and empower caregivers are pressing issues that need to be prioritized on the policy agenda in Asia. Of broader significance, the diverse capabilities across Asia present opportunities for cross-country learning and capacity-building.","[Ng, Reuben; Indran, Nicole] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 119260, Singapore; [Ng, Reuben] Natl Univ Singapore, Lloyds Register Fdn Inst Publ Understanding Risk, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ng, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 119260, Singapore.; Ng, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lloyds Register Fdn Inst Publ Understanding Risk, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",,"; Ng, Reuben/A-2931-2009","Indran, Nicole/0000-0003-3095-2988; Ng, Reuben/0000-0002-1186-0570",Social Science Research Council SSHR Fellowship [MOE2018-SSHR-004]; Lloyds Register Foundation IPUR Grant [IPUR-FY2019-RES-03-NG]; Amgen Biotechnology Singapore Research Grant,"We gratefully acknowledge support from the Social Science Research Council SSHR Fellowship (MOE2018-SSHR-004), Lloyds Register Foundation IPUR Grant (IPUR-FY2019-RES-03-NG) and Amgen Biotechnology Singapore Research Grant.

Such instruction was often organized digitally without much prior preparation. As a result, an increased exchange between teachers in online communities was to be expected. Analyzing the communication of the online community Twitter-Lehrerzimmer provided insight into topics and allowed to compare topics that were discussed before and during school closings. To identify topics, we applied computational linguistic analysis methods on 128,422 tweets and qualitative content analysis of 270 tweets. The results indicated that topics such as (a)synchronous digital teaching had already been discussed previously but was addressed more often and in more breadth during school closings. The Twitter-Lehrerzimmer was used for mutual support and exchange on urgent challenges such as the availability of high-quality software (compliant with data protection). The results reveal deficits in the German digitalization process from the perspective of teachers using Twitter and show the potential of online communities for information exchange and networking.","[Fuetterer, Tim; Stuermer, Kathleen; Fischer, Christian] Univ Tubingen, Hector Inst Empir Bildungsforsch, Europastr 6, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany; [Hoch, Emely; Scheiter, Katharina] Leibniz Inst Wissensmedien, Multiple Reprasentationen, Tubingen, Germany; [Lachner, Andreas] Univ Tubingen, Inst Erziehungswissensch, Tubingen, Germany; [Scheiter, Katharina] Univ Tubingen, Fachbereich Psychol, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Leibniz Institut fur Wissensmedien; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Futterer, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Hector Inst Empir Bildungsforsch, Europastr 6, D-72072 Tubingen, Germany.",tim.fuetterer@uni-tuebingen.de; e.hoch@iwm-tuebingen.de; kathleen.stuermer@uni-tuebingen.de; andreas.lachner@uni-tuebingen.de; christian.fischer@uni-tuebingen.de; k.scheiter@iwm-tuebingen.de,"Fütterer, Tim/AAW-2143-2021; Scheiter, Katharina/AAA-7429-2020","Fütterer, Tim/0000-0001-5399-9557; Scheiter, Katharina/0000-0002-9397-7544; Hoch, Emely/0000-0002-6534-1506",Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,50,2,2,1,6,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",1434-663X,1862-5215,,Z ERZIEHWISS,Z.

The article demonstrates the uses of location-based social network's data by analyzing the trends in check-ins throughout a three-year term for health purpose. We obtained the geolocation data from Sina Weibo, one of the biggest renowned Chinese microblogs (Weibo). The composed data is converted to geographic information system (GIS) type and assessed using temporal statistical analysis and spatial statistical analysis using kernel density estimation (KDE) assessment. We have applied various algorithms and trained machine learning models and finally satisfied with sequential model results because the accuracy we got was leading amongst others. The location cataloguing is accomplished via the use of facts about the characteristics of physical places. The findings demonstrate that visitors' spatial operations are more intense than residents' spatial operations, notably in downtown. However, locals also visited outlying regions, and tourists' temporal behaviors vary significantly while citizens' movements exhibit a more steady stable behavior. These findings may be used in destination management, metro planning, and the creation of digital cities.","[Hou, Li; Liu, Qi] Huangshan Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Huangshan 245041, Peoples R China; [Hou, Li; Liu, Qi] Huangshan Univ, Engn Technol Res Ctr Intelligent Microsyst Anh, Huangshan 245041, Peoples R China; [Hou, Li] Huangshan Ruixing Automot Elect Co Ltd, Huangshan 245461, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qi; Khan, Naimat Ullah] Shanghai Univ, Sch Commun & Informat Engn, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Nebhen, Jamel] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Comp Engn & Sci, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Uddin, Mueen] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Sch Digital Sci, Negara BE1410, Brunei Darussal; [Ullah, Mujahid] Preston Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan",Shanghai University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; University Brunei Darussalam,"Hou, L (通讯作者)，Huangshan Univ, Sch Informat Engn, Huangshan 245041, Peoples R China.; Hou, L (通讯作者)，Huangshan Univ, Engn Technol Res Ctr Intelligent Microsyst Anh, Huangshan 245041, Peoples R China.; Hou, L (通讯作者)，Huangshan Ruixing Automot Elect Co Ltd, Huangshan 245461, Peoples R China.",houli_shu@126.com; liuqi@shu.edu.cn; j.nebhen@psau.edu.sa; mueenmalik9516@gmail.com; mujahidullah09@gmail.com; naimat@shu.edu.cn,,"nebhen, jamel/0000-0002-8610-3451",Anhui Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Anhui Province [1908085MF178]; Anhui Key Research and Development Plan Project [202104b11020031]; Anhui Excellent Young Talents Support Program Project [gxyqZD2019069],"AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the Anhui Natural Science Foundation (No: 1908085MF178), the Anhui Key Research and Development Plan Project (No: 202104b11020031), and the Anhui Excellent Young Talents Support Program Project (No: gxyqZD2019069).",,35,0,0,1,1,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1748-670X,1748-6718,,COMPUT MATH METHOD M,Comput.

In the United States, there has been a strong partisan divide between the Democratic and Republican party's narratives about the pandemic which resulted in polarization of individual behaviors and divergent policy adoption across regions. As shown in this case, as well as in most major social issues, strongly polarized narrative frameworks facilitate such narratives. To understand polarization and other social chasms, it is critical to dissect these diverging narratives. Here, taking the Democratic and Republican political social media posts about the pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate that a combination of computational methods can provide useful insights into the different contexts, framing, and characters and relationships that construct their narrative frameworks which individual posts source from. Leveraging a dataset of tweets from the politicians in the U.S., including the ex-president, members of Congress, and state governors, we found that the Democrats' narrative tends to be more concerned with the pandemic as well as financial and social support, while the Republicans discuss more about other political entities such as China. We then perform an automatic framing analysis to characterize the ways in which they frame their narratives, where we found that the Democrats emphasize the government's role in responding to the pandemic, and the Republicans emphasize the roles of individuals and support for small businesses. Finally, we present a semantic role analysis that uncovers the important characters and relationships in their narratives as well as how they facilitate a membership categorization process. Our findings concretely expose the gaps in the elusive consensus between the two parties. Our methodologies may be applied to computationally study narratives in various domains.","[Jing, Elise; Ahn, Yong-Yeol] Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Jing, Elise] Sirius XM, 1221 Ave Amer 37th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol] Indiana Univ Network Sci Inst IUNI, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Ahn, Yong-Yeol] MIT, Connect Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Ahn, YY (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Luddy Sch Informat Comp & Engn, Ctr Complex Networks & Syst Res, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.; Ahn, YY (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ Network Sci Inst IUNI, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA.; Ahn, YY (通讯作者)，MIT, Connect Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",yyahn@iu.edu,"Ahn, Yong-Yeol/C-6334-2011","Ahn, Yong-Yeol/0000-0002-4352-4301",,,,59,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,2193-1127,,EPJ DATA SCI,EPJ Data Sci.,30-Oct,2021,10,1,,,,,,,53,10.1140/epjds/s13688-021-00308-4,,,18,"Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",,Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,WP2LD,WOS:000712968400001,34745825,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2022/4/10,

Existing media studies of age stereotypes have mostly been single-sourced. This study harnesses a 1.1-billion-word media database comprising the British National Corpus and Corpus of Contemporary American English-with genres including spoken/television, fiction, magazines, newspapers-to provide a comprehensive view of ageism in the United Kingdom and United States. The US and UK were chosen as they are home to the largest media conglomerates with tremendous power to shape public opinion. The most commonly used synonym of older adults was identified, and its most frequently used descriptors were analyzed for valence. Such computational linguistics techniques represent a new advance in studying aging narratives. The key finding is consistent, though no less alarming: Negative descriptions of older adults outnumber positive ones by six times. Negative descriptions tend to be physical, while positive ones tend to be behavioral. Magazines contain the highest levels of ageism, followed by the spoken genre, newspapers, and fiction. Findings underscore the need to increase public awareness of ageism and lay the groundwork to design targeted societal campaigns to tackle ageism-one of our generation's most pernicious threats.","[Ng, Reuben] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 119260, Singapore; [Ng, Reuben] Natl Univ Singapore, Lloyds Register Fdn, Inst Publ Understanding Risk, Singapore 119260, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Ng, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 119260, Singapore.; Ng, R (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lloyds Register Fdn, Inst Publ Understanding Risk, Singapore 119260, Singapore.",spprng@nus.edu.sg,"Ng, Reuben/A-2931-2009","Ng, Reuben/0000-0002-1186-0570",Social Science Research Council SSHR Fellowship [MOE2018-SSHR-004]; Lloyd's Register Foundation IPUR Grant [IPUR-FY2019-RES-03-NG],"We gratefully acknowledge the support by the Social Science Research Council SSHR Fellowship (MOE2018-SSHR-004), and the Lloyd's Register Foundation IPUR Grant (IPUR-FY2019-RES-03-NG).

We find that information seeking about climate change, measured by internet searches, notably increased in 2019 relative to prior years. Next, we analyze the impact of global climate marches on internet search activity and find that climate activist events are powerful drivers of attention compared to political events (United Nations Climate Change Conferences) and temperature abnormalities. To explore the role of media coverage, we estimate the effects of climate marches while controlling for weekly news coverage of climate change and find evidence supporting the notion of media attention mediating the effects of climate protests. Lastly, we quantify the duration of the increases in information seeking produced by these events. We find the durations are short-lived, with attention only staying above pre-event levels for several days. As the literature to date has paid scarce attention to public demonstrations as sources of influence on the public's attention to climate change, we suggest these results implore the field to focus more research on the impacts of climate activist events.","[Sisco, Matthew R.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY USA; [Pianta, Silvia; Bosetti, Valentina] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Weber, Elke U.] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sisco, Matthew R.; Pianta, Silvia; Bosetti, Valentina] RFF CMCC European Inst Econ & Environm, Milan, Italy",Columbia University; Bocconi University; Princeton University,"Sisco, MR (通讯作者)，403C Schermerhorn Hall MC5501,1190 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ms4403@columbia.edu,,"bosetti, valentina/0000-0003-4970-0027",European Research Council under the European CommunityEuropean Research Council (ERC) [336703]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [NSF1144854]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1463122]; Alice Bordini Staden,"This research was funded by 1.) the European Research Council under the European Community's Programme Ideas -Call identifier: ERC-2013-StG/ERC grant agreement no. 336703-project RISICO Risk and uncertainty in developing and implementing climate change policies, 2.) the National Science Foundation through the award NSF1144854 IGERT: From Data to Solutions: A New PhD Program in Transformational Data & Information Sciences Research and Innovation, 3.) the cooperative agreement NSF SES-1463122 awarded to the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions and 4.) generous support from Alice Bordini Staden.",,35,3,3,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0272-4944,1522-9610,,J ENVIRON PSYCHOL,J.

The proposed framework was applied on tweets posted regarding the police shooting to disperse protesters during the anti-Sterlite protests on May 22, 2018, at Thoothukudi in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The tweets were analyzed in two ways: (i) sentiment classification with automated computational methods and (ii) qualitatively examining the context of the expressed sentiments. In the case of anti-Sterlite protests, people expressed mixed emotions toward the protests for the closure of the Sterlite plant. A large negative sentiment toward the police shooting could be gleaned from the tweets.

From this wider perspective, social sciences have criticized the reductionist biomedical discourse, which has been dominating expert discourses for a long time. As these discourses determine the horizon of attributions and interventions, their lay interpretation plays a central role in the coping with depression. Methods: In order to map these patterns, online depression forums are analyzed with natural language processing methods, where computational tools are complemented with a qualitative approach. Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model of depression-related posts from the most popular English-speaking online health discussion forums (N = similar to 70 000) reveals the monolog (attributions and self-disclosures) and interactive (consultations and quasitherapeutic interactions) patterns. Results: Following the evaluation of various models 18 topics were differentiated: attributions referring to health, family, partnership and work issues; self-disclosures referring to contemplations, introducing the experience of suffering and well-being, along with diaries of everyday activities and hardships; consultations about psychotherapies, classifications, drugs and the experience; and quasi-therapeutic interactions relying on unconditional positive regards, recovery helpers experience or spirituality. These topics were evaluated from the perspective of the biopsychosocial model: the weight of each dimension was measured along with the discursive function. Conclusions: Biomedical discourse is underrepresented in lay discussions, while psychological discourse plays an overall dominant role. Even if actors are initially aware of the social mechanisms contributing to depression, they neglect these factors when it comes to considering the countermeasures.","[Nemeth, Renata; Sik, Domonkos; Katona, Eszter] ELTE Eotvos Lorand Univ Budapest, Fac Social Sci, Res Ctr Computat Social Sci, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-a, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",,"Nemeth, R (通讯作者)，ELTE Eotvos Lorand Univ Budapest, Fac Social Sci, Res Ctr Computat Social Sci, Pazmany Peter Setany 1-a, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",nemeth.renata@tatk.elte.hu; sik.domonkos@tatk.elte.hu; katona.eszter@tatk.elte.hu,,"Sik, Domonkos/0000-0002-0567-4587",Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities (ELTE-FKIP),This work was supported by the Higher Education Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities (ELTE-FKIP).

The current study aims to investigate and analyze the people top concerns and sentiment dynamics expressed in physician online reviews (PORs). (2) Methods: Text data were collected from four U.S.-based PRWs during the three time periods of 2018, 2019 and 2020. Based on the dynamic topic modeling, hot topics related to different aspects of healthcare were identified. Following the hybrid approach of aspect-based sentiment analysis, the social network of prevailing topics was also analyzed whether people expressed positive, neutral or negative sentiments in PORs. (3) Results: The study identified 30 dominant topics across three different stages which lead toward four key findings. First, topics discussed in Stage III were quite different from the earlier two stages due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Second, based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most prevalent keywords in all three stages were related to the treatment, questions asked by patients, communication problem, patients' feelings toward the hospital environment, disease symptoms, time spend with patients and different issues related to the COVID-19 (i.e., pneumonia, death, spread and cases). Third, topics related to the provider service quality, hospital servicescape and treatment cost were the most dominant topics in Stages I and II, while the quality of online information regarding COVID-19 and government countermeasures were the most dominant topics in Stage III. Fourth, when zooming into the topic-based sentiments analysis, hot topics in Stage I were mostly positive (joy be the dominant emotion), then negative (disgust be the dominant emotion) in Stage II. Furthermore, sentiments in the initial period of Stage III (COVID-19) were negative (anger be the dominant emotion), then transformed into positive (trust be the dominant emotion) later. The findings also revealed that the proposed method outperformed the conventional machine learning models in analyzing topic and sentiment dynamics expressed in PRWs. (4) Conclusions: Methodologically, this research demonstrates the ability and importance of computational techniques for analyzing large corpora of text and complementing conventional social science approaches.","[Shah, Adnan Muhammad] Univ Sialkot, Dept Informat Technol, Sialkot 51310, Pakistan; [Naqvi, Rizwan Ali] Sejong Univ, Dept Unmanned Vehicle Engn, Seoul 05006, South Korea; [Jeong, Ok-Ran] Gachon Univ, Sch Comp, Seongnam 1342, South Korea",Sejong University; Gachon University,"Shah, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Sialkot, Dept Informat Technol, Sialkot 51310, Pakistan.; Jeong, OR (通讯作者)，Gachon Univ, Sch Comp, Seongnam 1342, South Korea.",adnanshah486@gmail.com; rizwanali@sejong.ac.kr; orjeong@gachon.ac.kr,"Shah, Adnan/D-5424-2017; Shah, Adnan/AAF-4027-2021","Shah, Adnan/0000-0002-9638-3514; Shah, Adnan/0000-0002-9638-3514; Naqvi, Rizwan Ali/0000-0002-7473-8441","Basic Science Research Program through the NRF (National Research Foundation of Korea) - MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea [NRF2019R1A2C1008412]","This research was funded by the Basic Science Research Program through the NRF (National Research Foundation of Korea), funded by the MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT), Korea (Grant No. NRF2019R1A2C1008412).",,73,0,0,13,14,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Charting the representational clusters that cohere around Canadian Black male youth of Somali heritage reveals the circulation of stereotypical tropes that are mostly circumscribed within the framework of crime, terrorism, and violence, reflecting the intersection of stereotypes commonly ascribed to Muslims and to Black males. In the case of the Canadian Somali youth, this representation encompasses major narratives such as 'radicalization and terror', 'immigration and belonging', 'surveillance and safety', and 'gang violence' and, to a lesser extent, positive stories. To corroborate the first level of analysis, the computational analyses reveal four main topics and associations that are similar to the above findings, providing insight into the way Canadian Somali youth, especially men, are facing different challenges in their lived experiences in Canada.","[Jiwani, Yasmin] Concordia Univ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Al-Rawi, Ahmed] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Social Media News & Publ Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Concordia University - Canada; Simon Fraser University,"Al-Rawi, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Fac Commun Art & Technol, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",aalrawi@sfu.ca,,,,,,85,2,2,2,2,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-8849,1741-3001,,JOURNALISM,Journalism,JUL,2021,22,7,,,,,1757,1774,,10.1177/1464884919825503,,,18,Communication,,Communication,ST2CH,WOS:000662257100011,,,,,2022/4/10,

Natural language processing, textual processing, computational linguists, and biometrics are applied to perform sentiment analysis to identify and extract the emotions. In this work, sentiment analysis is carried out on a large Twitter dataset of English tweets. Ten emotional themes are investigated. Experimental results show that COVID-19 has spread fear/anxiety, gratitude, happiness and hope, and other mixed emotions among people for different reasons. Specifically, it is observed that positive news from top officials like Trump of chloroquine as cure to COVID-19 has suddenly lowered fear in sentiment, and happiness, gratitude, and hope started to rise. But, once FDA said, chloroquine is not effective cure, fear again started to rise.","[Alowibdi, Jalal S.] Univ Jeddah, Lib Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Alshdadi, Abdulrahman A.] Univ Jeddah, Dept Informat Syst & Technol, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Alshdadi, Abdulrahman A.] Univ Jeddah, Coll Comp Sci & Engn CCSE, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Daud, Ali; Dessouky, Mohamed M.] Univ Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; [Alhazmi, Essa Ali] Jazan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Jazan, Saudi Arabia",University of Jeddah; University of Jeddah; University of Jeddah; University of Jeddah; Jazan University,"Alowibdi, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Jeddah, Lib Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",,,,,,,39,2,2,15,28,IGI GLOBAL,HERSHEY,"701 E CHOCOLATE AVE, STE 200, HERSHEY, PA 17033-1240 USA",1552-6283,1552-6291,,INT J SEMANT WEB INF,Int.

This article focuses on a dimension of criminal justice which is the impact of imprisonment on families and seeks to unravel how knowledge about this problem is produced on SNSs. To this end, it draws on a study that explored conversational networks of key stakeholders on the SNS, Twitter. Building on insights from the study, the paper unravels interdependent sociotechnical dynamics that reproduce the offline marginality of affected families and operate as barriers to equitable knowledge production. Through its analysis of the dynamics, the paper provides new insights and advances the sparse criminological scholarship on the intersections of AI systems and the delivery of justice. It specifically highlights exclusionary epistemic processes that are fomented by the infrastructure of AI systems and the social contexts in which they are deployed.","[Ugwudike, Pamela; Fleming, Jenny] Univ Southampton, Criminol, Southampton, Hants, England; [Fleming, Jenny] Univ Southampton, Dept Sociol Social Policy & Criminol, Southampton, Hants, England",University of Southampton; University of Southampton,"Ugwudike, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Fac Social Sci, Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",p.ugwudike@soton.ac.uk,,"Ugwudike, Pamela/0000-0002-1084-7796",University of Southampton's Web Science Institute (UoS/WSI) Research Collaboration Stimulus Fund [2019/20],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the University of Southampton's Web Science Institute (UoS/WSI) Research Collaboration Stimulus Fund 2019/20.",,37,1,1,3,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1462-4745,1741-3095,,PUNISHM SOC,Punishm.

As community data are increasingly used to devise machine learning models to infer who might be at risk, there have been limited efforts to identify both risk and protective factors in web-based posts. These annotations can enrich and augment computational assessment approaches to identify appropriate intervention points, which are useful to public health professionals and suicide prevention researchers. Objective: This qualitative study aims to develop a valid and reliable annotation scheme for evaluating risk and protective factors for suicidal ideation in posts in suicide crisis forums. Methods: We designed a valid, reliable, and clinically grounded process for identifying risk and protective markers in social media data. This scheme draws on prior work on construct validity and the social sciences of measurement. We then applied the scheme to annotate 200 posts from r/SuicideWatch-a Reddit community focused on suicide crisis. Results: We documented our results on producing an annotation scheme that is consistent with leading public health information coding schemes for suicide and advances attention to protective factors. Our study showed high internal validity, and we have presented results that indicate that our approach is consistent with findings from prior work. Conclusions: Our work formalizes a framework that incorporates construct validity into the development of annotation schemes for suicide risk on social media. This study furthers the understanding of risk and protective factors expressed in social media data. This may help public health programming to prevent suicide and computational social science research and investigations that rely on the quality of labels for downstream machine learning tasks.","[Chancellor, Stevie] Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 200 Union St SE,4-189 Keller Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Sumner, Steven A.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Injury Prevent & Control, Off Strategy & Innovat, Atlanta, GA USA; [David-Ferdon, Corinne] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Violence Prevent, Atlanta, GA USA; [Ahmad, Tahirah; De Choudhury, Munmun] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Interact Comp, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Chancellor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota Twin Cities, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, 200 Union St SE,4-189 Keller Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",steviec@umn.edu,,"Chancellor, Stevie/0000-0003-0620-0903",National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01GM112697-01],"SC and MDC were supported in part by National Institutes of Health grant #R01GM112697-01.

Yet, direct observations of political topics in a wide set of religious settings are rare. We examine the nature of political speech by clergy with a novel dataset of over 110,000 sermons. Using a computational text analysis approach and multiple forms of validation, we find political content in more than a third of religious sermons and that seven of 10 pastors discuss political topics at some point. Common topics include the economy, war, homosexuality, welfare, and abortion. We then use a geographic data to link the sermons to demographic and political information around the church and to information about the church and pastor to evaluate the variation of political content in sermons. We find that most pastors-across location and denomination-engage around political topics, confirming the intertwined nature of religion and politics in the United States.","[Boussalis, Constantine] Trinity Coll Dublin, Polit Sci, Dublin, Ireland; [Coan, Travis G.] Univ Exeter, Quantitat Polit, Exeter, Devon, England; [Holman, Mirya R.] Tulane Univ, Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA USA",League of European Research Universities - LERU; Trinity College Dublin; University of Exeter; Tulane University,"Holman, MR (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",mholman@tulane.edu,"Holman, Mirya/I-6647-2016; Boussalis, Constantine/AAC-5373-2022","Holman, Mirya/0000-0001-6648-4122; ",Economic and Social Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [ES/N012283/1],"We benefited from generous comments from Erin Cassese, Ray Block, Roland Kappe, and Slava Mikhaylov.

Specifically, this study uses the state-of-the-art machine-learning model BERT to examine 25 news media outlets' coverage of gun violence, and then pairs the results with a two-wave panel survey conducted during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Results demonstrate that episodic framing of gun violence in the elite, mainstream media increased the issue salience among conservatives. However, exposure to episodically framed coverage of gun violence in like-minded partisan media made conservatives believe the issue was less important.","[Guo, Lei; Mays, Kate; Zhang, Yiyan] Boston Univ, Div Emerging Media Studies, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Wijaya, Derry; Betke, Margrit] Boston Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University; Boston University,"Guo, L (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Div Emerging Media Studies, Coll Commun, 640 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",guolei@bu.edu,,,,,,57,2,2,3,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1520-5436,1532-7825,,MASS COMMUN SOC,Mass Commun.

Customers are seeking to get the lowest price while airlines are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible and maximize their profit. Airlines use various kinds of computational techniques to increase their revenue such as demand prediction and price discrimination. From the customer side, two kinds of models are proposed by different researchers to save money for customers: models that predict the optimal time to buy a ticket and models that predict the minimum ticket price. In this paper, we present a review of customer side and airlines side prediction models. Our review analysis shows that models on both sides rely on limited set of features such as historical ticket price data, ticket purchase date and departure date. Features extracted from external factors such as social media data and search engine query are not considered. Therefore, we introduce and discuss the concept of using social media data for ticket/demand prediction. (c) 2019 The Authors.

While this phenomenon is well-documented through surveys, few studies investigate whether and how it manifests in the digital context, and what mechanisms underpin it. Drawing on social identity and intergroup theories, this study employs computational methods to explore to what extent political discussions on Reddit's r/politics are affectively polarized, and what communicative factors shape these affective biases. Results show that interactions between ideologically opposed users were significantly more negative than like-minded ones. These interactions were also more likely to be cut short than sustained if one user referred negatively to the other's political in-group. Conversely, crosscutting interactions in which one of the users expressed positive sentiment toward the out-group were more likely to attract a positive than a negative response, thus mitigating intergroup affective bias.

Active marketing is about receiving messages from potential buyers to create ways to influence their purchasing decisions. Advertising is one of the most prominent marketing strategies to promote products to consumers. It is well known that advertisement has a significant impact on the sale of certain goods or services. In this paper, we consider two mediums of advertisement, such as Facebook (which is an online medium) and Newspaper (which is a printed medium). We consider a dataset representing the advertising budget (in hundreds of US dollars) of an electronic company and the sales of that company. We apply the quantitative research approach, and the data which are used in this research are secondary data. For analysis purposes, we consider a statistical tool called simple linear regression modeling. To check the significance of the advertising on sale, definite statistical tests are applied. Based on the findings of this research, it is observed that advertising has a significant impact on sales. It is also showed that spending money on advertising through Facebook has better sales than newspapers. The finding of this research shows that the use of computer-based technologies and online mediums has a brighter future for advertising. Furthermore, a new statistical model is introduced using the Z family approach. The proposed model is very interesting and possesses heavy-tailed properties. Finally, the applicability of the proposed model is illustrated by considering the financial dataset.","[Lin, Yushan] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Marxism, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Ahmad, Zubair; Almaspoor, Zahra] Yazd Univ, Dept Stat, POB 89175741, Yazd, Iran; [Shafik, Wasswa] Intelligent Connect Res Lab, Dept Comp Engn, POB 89175741, Yazd, Iran; [Khosa, Saima K.] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Stat, Multan, Pakistan; [Alsuhabi, Hassan] Umm Al Qura Univ, Qunfudah Univ Coll, Dept Math, Mecca, Saudi Arabia; [Abbas, Faheem] Tanta Univ, Dept Engn Phys & Math, Fac Engn, Tanta 31521, Egypt; [Abbas, Faheem] Umm Al Qura Univ, Univ Coll Jamoum, Dept Math, Mecca 2064, Saudi Arabia",Xi'an Jiaotong University; University of Yazd; Bahauddin Zakariya University; Umm Al Qura University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University; Umm Al Qura University,"Ahmad, Z (通讯作者)，Yazd Univ, Dept Stat, POB 89175741, Yazd, Iran.; Khosa, SK (通讯作者)，Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Stat, Multan, Pakistan.",z.ferry21@gmail.com; saima.khosa@bzu.edu.pk,"SHAFIK, WASSWA/AAF-7518-2019","SHAFIK, WASSWA/0000-0002-9320-3186; Alsuhabi, Hassan/0000-0002-0658-0400",Philosophy and Social Science Research Project of Xi'an Polytechnic University [2020zsfp02],The first author acknowledges the Philosophy and Social Science Research Project of Xi'an Polytechnic University 2020zsfp02.,,37,0,0,6,7,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",1687-5265,1687-5273,,COMPUT INTEL NEUROSC,Comput.

Based on this model, the information propagation processes in a complete trust network and a non-complete trust network are analyzed. In particular, when studying the information propagation in non-complete trust networks, a multi-information propagation training credibility SIR (MPTC-SIR) model is designed. Each node carries credibility value through propagating train with MPTC-SIR model and then quantifies it as the trust probability of nodes to the information. Finally, the simulations about true and fake information propagation were implemented respectively on three different networks. The experimental results show that the designed network model is closer to reality. The information propagation scope is much wider in the high-order complete trust network, and the information demise is relatively slow. The fake information spreads faster in the high-order non-complete trust network. In general, the trend of bad news has wings was reflected. The propagation of true information is slow but it is lasted a long time than that of fake information. The propagation of fake information is just the opposite. The theory matches the physical world, and the research has very important practical significance.","[Nian, Fuzhong; Shi, Yayong; Cao, Jun] Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Commun, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University of Technology,"Nian, FZ (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Comp & Commun, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China.",gdnfz@lut.edu.cn; gdnfz@lut.edu.cn,,"Shi, Yayong/0000-0002-4390-5673",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [61863025]; Program for International S & T Cooperation Projects of Gansu province [144WCGA166]; Program for Longyuan Young Innovation Talents; Doctoral Foundation of LUT,"This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61863025), Program for International S & T Cooperation Projects of Gansu province (No. 144WCGA166), Program for Longyuan Young Innovation Talents and the Doctoral Foundation of LUT.",,42,0,0,14,14,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1877-7503,1877-7511,,J COMPUT SCI-NETH,J.

In this study, we argue that such movements are ultimately ineffective because they struggle to sustain themselves over time and identify the reasons behind their transience. Our analysis focuses on Twitter conversations about Aadhaar, a biometric ID project that has raised concerns about data privacy and civil liberty in India, the world's largest democracy. A computational mixed-methods approach incorporating social network analysis, sentiment analysis, and structural topic modeling demonstrates that connective action against Aadhaar failed to produce a sustained discourse of resistance, with people's feelings toward and beliefs about Aadhaar vacillating sharply. The analysis draws attention to the power of brick-and-mortar social institutions, including the state and its agencies, political parties, courts, technology companies, and 'legacy' news media, in shaping and reshaping seemingly bottom-up discourses on digital platforms. It also identifies three interlinked weaknesses of connective action - the individualized nature of mobilization, excessive flexibility of social networks, and a negative emotional culture. We contend that in order to be effective, contemporary social movements need to utilize digital technologies for 'collective' action by forging collective identities that bind participants affectively and cognitively, empower them against structures of social control, and enable them to commit to non-personal and long-term objectives.","[Shahin, Saif] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Ng, Yee Man Margaret] Univ Illinois, Dept Journalism, Champaign, IL USA",American University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Shahin, S (通讯作者)，4400 Massachusetts Ave,NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",saif.shahin@gmail.com,,"Shahin, Saif/0000-0002-7608-7283",,,,51,1,1,6,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1474-2837,1474-2829,,SOC MOVEMENT STUD,Soc.

Although many studies extensively explored the role of corporate language policy in large corporations, employees' perceptions of such policy has not been explored adequately. Fewer studies investigate the trends in such perceptions in social media texts. This study fills this gap; it examines the barriers in multinational companies that have adopted a foreign language and analyses employees' attitudes. The study uses computer-assisted text analysis to investigate changes in employees' perceptions of an English-only policy in Rakuten, a Japanese company. It analyses a corpus of 704 social media posts on OpenWork from 2010 to 2018. The study finds some trends in employees' attitudes such as the inconsistency between expectation and reality in terms of 'Englishnization' and the popularity of the Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC). The findings suggest that Rakuten is not global in the true sense; the value of the TOEIC score is overestimated and the neoliberal employment system affects employees in complex ways. This study contributes to international business language with a bottom-up, employee-centred, and diachronic perspective on language management.","[Zhang, Ziyuan] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Profess & Intercultural Commun, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Zhang, ZY (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Profess & Intercultural Commun, Bergen, Norway.",ziyuan.zhang@nhh.no,,,,,,69,0,0,1,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-4632,1747-7557,,J MULTILING MULTICUL,J.

The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first pandemic experienced by a world connected through the internet. We analyzed 105+ million tweets collected between March 1 and May 15, 2020, and Weibo messages compiled between January 20 and May 15, 2020, covering six languages (English, Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and Chinese) and represented an estimated 2.4 billion citizens worldwide. To examine fine-grained emotions during a pandemic, we built machine learning classification models based on deep learning language models to identify emotions in social media conversations about COVID-19, including positive expressions (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), negative expressions (pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, and denial), and a complicated expression, joking, which has not been explored before. Our analysis indicates a rapid increase and a slow decline in the volume of social media conversations regarding the pandemic in all six languages. The upsurge was triggered by a combination of economic collapse and confinement measures across the regions to which all the six languages belonged except for Chinese, where only the latter drove conversations. Tweets in all analyzed languages conveyed remarkably similar emotional states as the epidemic was elevated to pandemic status, including feelings dominated by a mixture of joking with anxious/pessimistic/annoyed as the volume of conversation surged and shifted to a general increase in positive states (optimistic, thankful, and empathetic), the strongest being expressed in Arabic tweets, as the pandemic came under control.","[Zhang, Xiangliang; Yang, Qiang; Albaradei, Somayah; Alamro, Hind; Salhi, Adil; Ma, Changsheng; Alshehri, Manal; Tifratene, Faroug; Gojobori, Takashi; Gao, Xin] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn CEMSE Div, Computat Biosci Res Ctr CBRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Lyu, Xiaoting; Wang, Wei] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jaber, Inji Ibrahim] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, IT Dept, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr RSRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia; [Duarte, Carlos M.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Computat Biosci Res Ctr CBRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; Beijing Jiaotong University; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; King Abdullah University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, XL; Gao, X (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Comp Elect & Math Sci & Engn CEMSE Div, Computat Biosci Res Ctr CBRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.; Wang, W (通讯作者)，Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Duarte, CM (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Red Sea Res Ctr RSRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.; Duarte, CM (通讯作者)，King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol KAUST, Computat Biosci Res Ctr CBRC, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.",Xiangliang.Zhang@kaust.edu.sa; wangwei1@bjtu.edu.cn; Carlos.Duarte@kaust.edu.sa; Xin.Gao@kaust.edu.sa,"Duarte Quesada, Carlos Manuel/ABD-6208-2021; Duarte, Carlos M./A-7670-2013; Gao, Xin/D-5487-2013","Duarte, Carlos M./0000-0002-1213-1361; Alamro, Hind/0000-0001-6604-9905; Gao, Xin/0000-0002-7108-3574; Ma, Changsheng/0000-0003-2258-8530; Zhang, Xiangliang/0000-0002-3574-5665; Albaradei, Somayah/0000-0003-4317-2358","Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia [FCC/1/1976-17-01, FCC/1/1976-18-01, FCC/1/1976-19-01, FCC/1/1976-23-01, FCC/1/1976-24-01, FCC/1/1976-25-01, FCC/1/1976-26-01, FCC/1/1976-31-01]","The research reported in this publication was supported by funding from Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia, with award numbers FCC/1/1976-17-01, FCC/1/1976-18-01, FCC/1/1976-19-01, FCC/1/1976-23-01, FCC/1/1976-24-01, FCC/1/1976-25-01, FCC/1/1976-26-01 and FCC/1/1976-31-01.

As one of the most popular social media platforms in China, the Sina Weibo microblogging website has millions of users. Of these, vital users play an important role in impacting other common users' online behaviors, promoting online information dissemination, and leading public opinion trends. Therefore, it is of theoretical and practical interest to study the identification of vital users on the Sina Weibo network. In contrast to traditional approaches, after investigating the unique characteristics of the vital users in the Sina Weibo network, we proposed an end-to-end computational model based on the deep graph neural network. The proposed model introduced a simplified graph attention mechanism to incorporate the information of both the follower and followee networks of users, which can maintain a relatively low computational cost compared with the traditional GAT model but at the same time maintain comparable detection accuracy. The comparison experiments between the proposed model, classic node ranking methods, and graph embedding-based classifiers verified that the proposed model has the best accuracy in detecting vital users in the Sina Weibo network.

The cost of communication is quantified using the proximity of the potential members in a social network. We study a TFP with two measures for communication effectiveness; namely, we minimize the sum of communication costs, and we impose an upper bound on the largest communication cost. This problem can be formulated as a constrained quadratic set covering problem. Our experiments show that a general-purpose solver is capable of solving small and medium-sized instances to optimality. We propose a branch-and-bound algorithm to solve larger sizes: we reformulate the problem and relax it in such a way that it decomposes into a series of linear set covering problems, and we impose the relaxed constraints through branching. Our computational experiments show that the algorithm is capable of solving large-size instances, which are intractable for the solver. Summary of Contribution: This paper presents an exact algorithm for the Team Formation Problem (TFP), in which the aim is, given a project and its required skills, to construct a capable team that can communicate and collaborate effectively. This combinatorial optimization problem is modeled as a quadratic set covering problem. The study provides a novel branch-and-bound algorithm where a reformulation of the problem is relaxed so that it decomposes into a series of linear set covering problems and the relaxed constraints are imposed through branching. The algorithm is able to solve instances that are intractable for commercial solvers. The study illustrates an efficient usage of algorithmic methods and modelling techniques for an operations research problem. It contributes to the field of computational optimization by proposing a new application as well as a new algorithm to solve a quadratic version of a classical combinatorial optimization problem.","[Berktas, Nihal] Bilkent Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey; [Yaman, Hande] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Res Ctr Operat & Res & Stat ORSTAT, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University; KU Leuven,"Berktas, N (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Dept Ind Engn, TR-06800 Cankaya, Turkey.",nihal.berktas@bilkent.edu.tr; hande.yaman@kuleuven.be,,"Yaman, Hande/0000-0002-3392-1127",,,,46,0,0,3,4,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1091-9856,1526-5528,,INFORMS J COMPUT,INFORMS J.

In repeated clinical studies, nearly half of those who received clinical doses of the HealtheRx shared their information with others (social doses). Clinical trial design cannot fully capture the impact of information diffusion, which can act as a force multiplier for the intervention. Furthermore, experimentation is needed to understand how intervention delivery can optimize social spread under varying circumstances. To study information diffusion from CRx under varying conditions, we built an agent-based model (ABM). This study describes the model building process and illustrates how an ABM provides insight about information diffusion through in silico experimentation. To build the ABM, we constructed a synthetic population (agents) using publicly-available data sources. Using clinical trial data, we developed empirically-informed processes simulating agent activities, resource knowledge evolution and information sharing. Using RepastHPC and chiSIM software, we replicated the intervention in silico, simulated information diffusion processes, and generated emergent information diffusion networks. The CRx ABM was calibrated using empirical data to replicate the CRx intervention in silico. We used the ABM to quantify information spread via social versus clinical dosing then conducted information diffusion experiments, comparing the social dosing effect of the intervention when delivered by physicians, nurses or clinical clerks. The synthetic population (N = 802,191) exhibited diverse behavioral characteristics, including activity and knowledge evolution patterns. In silico delivery of the intervention was replicated with high fidelity. Large-scale information diffusion networks emerged among agents exchanging resource information. Varying the propensity for information exchange resulted in networks with different topological characteristics. Community resource information spread via social dosing was nearly 4 fold that from clinical dosing alone and did not vary by delivery mode. This study, using CRx as an example, demonstrates the process of building and experimenting with an ABM to study information diffusion from, and the population-level impact of, a clinical information-based intervention. While the focus of the CRx ABM is to recreate the CRx intervention in silico, the general process of model building, and computational experimentation presented is generalizable to other large-scale ABMs of information diffusion.","[Lindau, Stacy Tessler; Makelarski, Jennifer A.; Abramsohn, Emily M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lindau, Stacy Tessler] Univ Chicago, Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lindau, Stacy Tessler] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Geriatr & Palliat Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Lindau, Stacy Tessler] Univ Chicago, Bucksbaum Inst Clin Excellence, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Kaligotla, Chaitanya; Collier, Nicholson; Macal, Charles M.; Ozik, Jonathan] Argonne Natl Lab, Decis & Infrastruct Sci Div, Lemont, IL USA; [Kaligotla, Chaitanya] Simon Fraser Univ, Beedie Sch Business, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Beiser, David G.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Emergency Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Chou, Chiahung] Auburn Univ, Dept Hlth Outcomes Res & Policy, Auburn, AL 36849 USA; [Collier, Nicholson; Macal, Charles M.; Ozik, Jonathan] Univ Chicago, Consortium Adv Sci & Engn, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Huang, Elbert S.; Tung, Elizabeth L.] Univ Chicago, Dept Med, Sect Gen Internal Med, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago; Robert H.

With the growing political polarization on scientific issues, the COVID-19 vaccine-related sentiment has recently been divided across ideological lines. This study aims to understand how vaccine favorability and specific vaccine-related concerns including possible side effects, distrust in medical professionals, and conspiratorial beliefs concerning COVID-19 vaccines were articulated and transmitted by Twitter users from opposing ideological camps and with different follower scopes. Using a combination of computational approaches, including supervised machine-learning and structural topic modeling, we examined tweets surrounding COVID-19 vaccination (N = 16,959) from 1 March to 30 June 2020. Results from linear mixed-effects models suggested that Twitter users high on conservative ideology and with a standard instead of large follower scope tend to express less favorable vaccine-related sentiments and talk more about vaccine side effects, distrust of medical professionals, and conspiracy theories. There is also an interaction effect where liberals with large follower scope expressed the least amount of distrust of medical professionals, whereas extreme conservatives expressed greater distrust for health professionals, regardless of their follower scope. Finally, structural topic modeling revealed distinct topical focuses among liberal and conservative users. Theoretical and practical implications for leveraging social media in effective health communication practice were discussed.","[Jiang, Xiaoya; Su, Min-Hsin; Hwang, Juwon; Lian, Ruixue; Brauer, Markus; Kim, Sunghak; Shah, Dhavan] Univ Wisconsin Madison, 821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Jiang, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Madison, 821 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xjiang267@wisc.edu,,"Shah, Dhavan/0000-0001-5034-2816; Jiang, Xiaoya/0000-0001-5903-4019; Hwang, Juwon/0000-0002-5155-1000",John S. and James; L.

We contribute to the literature by applying the NPF to fracking policy debates in New York using well-established Natural Language Processing tools, including sentiment analysis. We combine this computational approach with a qualitative hand-coding of pro- and antifracking Twitter influentials. This approach allows us to consider a much larger corpus of tweets over a much longer time frame than has been done thus far. We adapt and test NPF propositions related to the use of the devil/angel shift strategies before and after a major state-wide policy change, that is, a state-wide moratorium on high volume hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Overall, we find evidence for the use of the devil shift narrative strategy by the pro-fracking coalition aimed at the Governor prior to the moratorium. After the moratorium, the relative percentage of Tweets containing devil shift sentiments decreases as the pro-fracking coalition generally downshifts in its use of angel shift language without a corresponding increase in devil shift language, whereas, conversely, the anti-fracking coalition generally downshifts in its use of devil shift language without a general increase in angel shift language. When we shifted our analysis to Tweets containing fracking and the Governor, we found a similar postban decrease in devil shift language among anti-fracking users. Our findings offer lessons for using computational tools in the NPF as an approach to expand analytic ability and for the operationalization of concepts such as narrative strategies and policy entrepreneurs.","[Pattison, Andrew] Colgate Univ, Environm Studies Program, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Cipolli, William, III] Colgate Univ, Dept Math, New York, NY 13346 USA; [Marichal, Jose] Calif Lutheran Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Thousand Oaks, CA USA",Colgate University; Colgate University; California Lutheran University,"Pattison, A (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Environm Studies Program, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",apattison@colgate.edu,,,Colgate University Faculty Research Council; Data Science Collaboratory at Colgate University,This research was supported by the Colgate University Faculty Research Council and the Data Science Collaboratory at Colgate University,,49,2,2,1,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,,REV POLICY RES,Rev.

Early detection of signs of mental health problems is particularly important, since unattended, they can be life-threatening. This is why a deep understanding of the complex manifestations of mental disorder development is important. We present a study of mental disorders in social media, from different perspectives. We are interested in understanding whether monitoring language in social media could help with early detection of mental disorders, using computational methods. We developed deep learning models to learn linguistic markers of disorders, at different levels of the language (content, style, emotions), and further try to interpret the behavior of our models for a deeper understanding of mental disorder signs. We complement our prediction models with computational analyses grounded in theories from psychology related to cognitive styles and emotions, in order to understand to what extent it is possible to connect cognitive styles with the communication of emotions over time. The final goal is to distinguish between users diagnosed with a mental disorder and healthy users, in order to assist clinicians in diagnosing patients. We consider three different mental disorders, which we analyze separately and comparatively: depression, anorexia, and self-harm tendencies. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

Our findings reveal that the 10 most influential bots in our dataset all presented an anti-immigration viewpoint, and both posted original tweets and retweeted other bot accounts' tweets to give a false sense of authenticity and anti-immigration consensus. Bots' messages relied heavily on negative emotional appeals by spreading harassing language and disinformation likely intended to evoke fear toward immigrants. Such accounts also employed polarizing language to entrench political group identity and provoke partisanship. Our findings help to understand the interaction and messaging tactics employed by political bots and suggest potential strategies that may be employed to counter their effectiveness.","[Nonnecke, Brandie] Univ Calif Berkeley, CITRIS Policy Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Perez de Acha, Gisela] Invest Reporting Program, Berkeley, CA USA; [Choi, Annette] POLITICO Pro, Arlington, VA USA; [Crittenden, Camille] Univ Calif Berkeley, CITRIS, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Crittenden, Camille] Univ Calif Berkeley, Banatao Inst, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Gutierrez Cortes, Fernando Ignacio] Tecnol Monterrey, Sch Human & Educ, Monterrey, Mexico; [Martin Del Campo, Alejandro] Tecnol Monterrey, Media & Digital Culture, Monterrey, Mexico; [Miranda-Villanueva, Oscar Mario] Tecnol Monterrey, Media Commun, Monterrey, Mexico",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Nonnecke, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, CITRIS Policy Lab, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",nonnecke@berkeley.edu,,,University of California Institute for Mexico; United States (UC MEXUS); Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACYT)Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),This work was supported by the University of California Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS) and the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia de Mexico (CONACYT).,,60,0,0,4,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1933-1681,1933-169X,,J INF TECHNOL POLITI,J.

The measurement of the spreading capabilities of nodes is an attractive challenge in this field. Node centrality is one of the most popular methods used to identify the influential nodes, which includes the degree centrality (DC), betweenness centrality (BC) and closeness centrality (CC). The DC is an efficient method but not effective. The BC and CC are effective but not efficient. They have high computational complexity. To balance the effectiveness and efficiency, this paper proposes the neighborhood entropy centrality to rank the influential nodes. The proposed method uses the notion of entropy to improve the DC. For evaluating the performance, the susceptible-infected-recovered model is used to simulate the information spreading process of messages on nine real-world networks. The experimental results reveal the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.","[Qiu, Liqing; Zhang, Jianyi; Tian, Xiangbo; Zhang, Shuang] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Shandong Prov Key Lab Wisdom Mine Informat Techno, 579 Qianwangang Rd, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Science & Technology,"Qiu, LQ (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Coll Comp Sci & Engn, Shandong Prov Key Lab Wisdom Mine Informat Techno, 579 Qianwangang Rd, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China.",qiuliqing2019@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71772107]; Shandong Nature Science Foundation of China [ZR2020MF044],National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71772107); Shandong Nature Science Foundation of China (grant no.

Such media-aware stock movements essentially comprise a multimodal problem. Two unique challenges arise in processing these multimodal data. First, information from one data mode will interact with information from other data modes. A common strategy is to concatenate various data modes into one compound vector; however, this strategy ignores the interactions among different modes. The second challenge is the heterogeneity of the data in terms of sampling time. Specifically, fundamental data consist of continuous values sampled at fixed time intervals, whereas news information emerges randomly. This heterogeneity can cause valuable information to be partially missing or can distort the feature spaces. In addition, the study of media-aware stock movements in previous work has focused on the one-to-one problem, in which it is assumed that news affects only the performance of the stocks mentioned in the reports. However, news articles also impact related stocks and cause stock co-movements. In this article, we propose a tensor-based event-driven LSTM model to address these challenges. Experiments performed on the China securities market demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms, including AZFinText, eMAQT, and TeSIA.","[Li, Qing; Tan, Jinghua; Wang, Jun] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Financial Intelligence & Financial Engn Key Lab S, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Qing; Tan, Jinghua; Wang, Jun] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ Informat Engn, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hsinchun] Univ Arizona, Dept Management Informat Syst, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China; University of Arizona,"Tan, JH (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Financial Intelligence & Financial Engn Key Lab S, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.; Tan, JH (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ Informat Engn, Chengdu 610074, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",liqing@swufe.edu.cn; jinghuatan.swufe@gmail.com; wangjun1987@swufe.edu.cn; hchen@eller.arizona.edu,,"Wang, Jun/0000-0002-2613-2752","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71671141, 71873108]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [JBK 171113, JBK 170505, JBK 1806003]; Sichuan Province Science and Technology Department [2019YJ0250]; Financial Innovation Center of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics; U.S. National Science Foundation at the University of Arizona [ACI-1443019, CMMI-1442116]","This work has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71671141, 71873108), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (JBK 171113, JBK 170505, JBK 1806003), Sichuan Province Science and Technology Department (2019YJ0250), and the Financial Innovation Center of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics.

While machine learning approaches usually perform better, they offer little insight into (a) which of the assumptions underlying dictionary approaches (bag-of-words, domain transferability, or additivity) impedes performance most, and (b) which language features drive the algorithmic classification most strongly. To fill both gaps, we offer a systematic assumption-based error analysis, using the integrative complexity of social media comments as our case in point. We show that attacking the additivity assumption offers the strongest potential for improving dictionary performance. We also propose to combine off-the-shelf dictionaries with supervised glass box machine learning algorithms (as opposed to the usual black box machine learning approaches) to classify texts and learn about the most important features for classification. This dictionary-plus-supervised-learning approach performs similarly well as classic full-text machine learning or deep learning approaches, but yields interpretable results in addition, which can inform theory development on top of enabling a valid classification.","[Dobbrick, Timo; Jakob, Julia; Chan, Chung-Hong] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res, Mannheim, Germany; [Wessler, Hartmut] Univ Mannheim, Inst Media & Commun Studies, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim; University of Mannheim,"Dobbrick, T (通讯作者)，Mannheimer Zentrum Europaische Sozialforsch MZES, A 5,6,A Raum 215, D-68159 Mannheim, Germany.",Timo.Dobbrick@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,"; Chan, Chung-hong/D-6946-2013","Jakob, Julia/0000-0003-2340-5193; Wessler, Hartmut/0000-0003-4216-5471; Chan, Chung-hong/0000-0002-6232-7530; Dobbrick, Timo/0000-0002-6252-1157",Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [260291564],This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [260291564].,,49,1,1,1,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

This research uses weather data, international oil price data and social news to conduct sentiment analysis to predict future agricultural product price trends. The resulting data is then displayed using rolling and recursive window methods for segmentation and evaluation. The research results show that adding emotional scores and oil prices to predict agricultural product prices can effectively improve the prediction results. In terms of segmentation performance, the linear regression provides better prediction results than the quantile regression, and the recursive window method provides better prediction results than the rolling window.","[Xu, Jia-Lang] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Doctoral Program Data Sci & Ind Analyt, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Hsu, Ying-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Math, Taichung 402, Taiwan; [Hsu, Ying-Lin] Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan",National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University; National Chung Hsing University,"Hsu, YL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Dept Appl Math, Taichung 402, Taiwan.; Hsu, YL (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Hsing Univ, Inst Stat, Taichung 402, Taiwan.",jlxu.academy@gmail.com; yllhsu@nchu.edu.tw,,"Xu, Jia-Lang/0000-0002-8052-9419",,,,18,2,2,5,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Even though social media is used for benevolent purposes, a few use this platform for deviant activities such as cyberbullying, cyber warfare or propaganda, disinformation and fake news dissemination to influence the masses. With the availability of inexpensive and ubiquitous mass communication tools like social media, disseminating false information and propaganda is both convenient and effective. Social media in general and blogs in particular act as virtual spaces where narratives are framed. In order to generate discourse, web traffic needs to be driven to these virtual spaces. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and other websites are therefore used as vehicles to disseminate the content. This link between blogs and social media platforms is vital to examine disinformation campaigns. In this research, we examine the role of media orchestration strategies, more specifically, cross-media and mix-media strategies in conducting disinformation campaigns. The paper presents an in-depth examination of the information networks using social network analysis and cyber forensic-based methodology, to identify prominent information actors and leading coordinators of the disinformation campaigns. Using the developed research methodology, the study reveals a massive disinformation coordination campaign pertaining to the Baltic region conducted primarily on blogs but strategically linking to a variety of other social media platforms, e.g., Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, VKontakte, among others.","[Bandeli, Kiran Kumar; Agarwal, Nitin] Univ Arkansas, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; University of Arkansas Little Rock,"Bandeli, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Little Rock, AR 72204 USA.",kxbandeli@ualr.edu; nxagarwal@ualr.edu,,,,,,27,1,1,11,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-298X,1572-9346,,COMPUT MATH ORGAN TH,Comput.

Instrumental to this wave is the notion of the People, harnessed by populists' rhetoric to their political advantage. Yet only little is known on the various, even contradicting meanings of the People in political discourse. Drawing on popular sovereignty theories and representation studies, in this paper I develop a theoretical framework of four key facets of the People-political, national, spatial, and abstract, and their two dimensions-concrete and diffuse. I argue that while elections are associated primarily with the political facet of the People, cross-temporal approaches to electoral representation highlight the People as a multifaceted construct. I explore these theoretical conjectures with computational text analysis of news media coverage of the 2016 American election. I find that the People is a multidimensional construct, with temporal dynamics that connect the political facet with the broader political agency of the People. However, this connection holds only before the 2016 election, and not after them. The results are discussed in relation to populism and the challenges democracies are facing.","[Lavi, Liron] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Y&S Nazarian Ctr Israel Studies, 11362 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Lavi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Y&S Nazarian Ctr Israel Studies, 11362 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",laviliron@ucla.edu,,,,,,49,0,0,0,0,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1680-4333,1682-0983,,EUR POLIT SCI,Eur.

Studies link media freedom to other concepts including human rights, corruption, democratic peace and conflict, natural resource wealth, political knowledge and foreign aid. However, media freedom's many facets make it difficult for any single index to fully capture. To develop a more robust measure, this article treats media freedom as a latent variable and analyzes ten extant indicators by fitting an item response theory model. Utilizing a Bayesian approach, the model generates time-series, cross-sectional data on a bounded, unidimensional scale from 0 to 1 that measures media freedom in 197 countries from 1948 to 2017. After numerous validity checks, the authors utilize their new Media System Freedom data to replicate Egorov, Guriev and Sonin's (2009) analysis of media freedom and natural resource wealth. The findings indicate that the published results do not hold once the more robust measure is included.","[Solis, Jonathan A.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA; [Waggoner, Philip D.] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",William & Mary; University of Chicago,"Solis, JA (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",jsolis@aiddata.wm.edu,,"Waggoner, Philip/0000-0002-7825-7573; Solis, Jonathan/0000-0002-2570-7411",University of Houston (CLASS Dissertation Completion Fellowship),"The authors would like to thank Ryan Kennedy, Eduardo Aleman, Elizabeth Stein, Jennifer Clark, the editors, and anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions.

Instead of using count-based traditional sentiment index methods, the study uses its own sum and relevance based sentiment index mechanism. Hourly price data has been used in this research as daily data is too late and minutes data is too early for getting the exclusive effect of sentiments. Normally, hourly data is extremely costly and difficult to manage and analyze. Hourly data has been rarely used in similar kinds of researches. To built sentiment index, text analytic information has been parsed and analyzed, textual information that is relevant to selected stocks has been collected, aggregated, categorized, and refined with NLP and eventually converted scientifically into hourly sentiment index. News analytic sources include mainstream media, print media, social media, news feeds, blogs, investors' advisory portals, experts' opinions, brokers updates, web-based information, company' internal news and public announcements regarding policies and reforms. The results of the study indicate that sentiments significantly influence the direction of stocks, on average after 3-4 h. Top ten companies from High-tech, financial, medical, automobile sectors are selected, and six LSTM models, three for using text-analytic and other without analytic are used. Every model includes 1, 3, and 6 h steps back. For all sectors, a 6-hour steps based model outperforms the other models due to LSTM specialty of keeping long term memory. Collective accuracy of textual analytic models is way higher relative to non-textual analytic models.","[Khalil, Faisal; Pipa, Gordon] Inst Cognit Sci, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany",,"Khalil, F (通讯作者)，Inst Cognit Sci, D-49090 Osnabruck, Germany.",fkhalil@uni-osnabrueck.de; gpipa@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,58,0,0,10,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Although Turkey is considered one of the world's worst jailers of journalists, its media market is one of the fastest-growing in the world. In 2015, the Istanbul-based English-language TRT World was launched with the slogan 'where news inspires change', The channel promised to provide impartial coverage of global news, with its experienced journalists addressing global audiences. In this study, we investigate the interplay between public diplomacy and editorial policies at TRT World. After conducting in-depth interviews with TRT World journalists, we argue that the channel has shifted its style from being Turkey's public diplomacy tool into becoming the AKP's voice to the world.

As a result, sharing aggregated forms of social information is becoming increasingly popular. However, it is unknown whether sharing aggregated information improves people's judgments more than sharing the full available information. Here, we compare the performance of groups in estimation tasks when social information is fully shared versus when it is first averaged and then shared. We find that improvements in estimation accuracy are comparable in both cases. However, our results reveal important differences in subjects' behaviour: (i) subjects follow the social information more when receiving an average than when receiving all estimates, and this effect increases with the number of estimates underlying the average; (ii) subjects follow the social information more when it is higher than their personal estimate than when it is lower. This effect is stronger when receiving all estimates than when receiving an average. We introduce a model that sheds light on these effects, and confirms their importance for explaining improvements in estimation accuracy in all treatments.","[Jayles, Bertrand; Kurvers, Ralf H. J.

I examined the key algorithmic processes in the intersection of its technological infrastructure, cultural processes, and social relations by employing Taina Bucher's three methodological tactics for 'unknowing' algorithms. Drawing from media logic and computational logic, I propose the concept of 'algorithmic logics' to define the assumptions, processes, and mechanisms that govern the construction of taste within the Netflix platform. I identified these four logics of taste - datafication, reconfiguration, interpellation, and reproduction - and argue that they reappropriate old apparatuses of social control and generate new capacities in engineering cultural processes. Together, these logics transform algorithms from procedural to self-generative machines in the guise of algorithmic objectivity, user agency, and post-demographic experiences. Algorithmic logics function as an 'interpretative schema' in making sense algorithms in their entanglement with social actors, institutions, and infrastructures.","[Gaw, Fatima] Univ Philippines, Quezon City, Philippines",University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Diliman,"Gaw, F (通讯作者)，Univ Philippines, Dept Commun Res, Plaridel Hall,Ylanan St, Quezon City 1104, Metro Manila, Philippines.",migaw@up.edu.ph,,"Gaw, Fatima/0000-0002-6577-7940",,,,53,1,1,11,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.
