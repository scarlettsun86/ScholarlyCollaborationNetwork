Contrary to current definitions of computational science, which emphasizes its inductive nature, we define computational research as an incomplete inductive process, blending both theoretical and data-driven methods of discovery. Communication theory needs to be driven by a clear concept of human needs and abilities, recovering and extending known theoretical insights from mass and interpersonal communication research. The definition we propose for computational communication research has a practical implication. Relying on theory, the definition demands to identify specific processes and domains within the field of computational communication research. The processes include communication production, behavior, and effects. The domains include collaboration, trust, and data storytelling and journalism, while the methods include content and network analyses. The article starts with a broad definition of the computational approach, using the Johari window. We continue with a typology of computational communication research, which blends reviews of foundational texts with summaries of leading research. In the conclusions, we discuss the strengths and identify new opportunities in the field of computational communication research.

Based on a narrative literature review, we identify three key contributions of the ANT perspective in computational communication science: First, ANT enables us to address the role of technology in communication and the relationships between nonhumans and humans in more detail. Second, we may reflect more explicitly on the epistemological status of computational methods. Third, we can question the normative and ethical assumptions guiding our research.

Among the social sciences, communication stands out as a discipline with a relatively low-profile institutionalized focus on the in-house development of methods. Computational tools are changing this, and they are catalyzing a new set of methods directly suited to tackling foundational research questions in communication. We systematically review how computational methods affect the three fundamental pillars of the scientific method: observational approaches (i.e., digital trace data), theoretical approaches (i.e., computer simulations), and experimental research (i.e., virtual labs and field experiments). We stress that data are a catalyzer but not a requirement for computational science. We explore how observational, theoretical, and experimental approaches can be combined and cross-fertilize one another. We conclude that taking advantage of computational methods will require a systematic effort in our discipline to develop and adjust these methods.","[Hilbert, Martin; Barnett, George; Frey, Seth; Shen, Cuihua (Cindy); Zhang, Jingwen] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Blumenstock, Joshua] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Contractor, Noshir] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Diesner, Jana] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL USA; [Gonzalez-Bailon, Sandra] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lamberso, P.

In this article, we argue that ABMs have the potential to advance communication research in general, and computational communication science (CCS) in particular, by helping scholars address two major gaps. First, by generating emergent global phenomena from individual interactions, ABMs make it possible to explicitly link micro and macro perspectives in communication research. Second, by formalizing theories, ABMs offer mechanism-based explanations for observed empirical patterns in data. To familiarize more communication scholars with this approach, this article provides a systematic overview of the potentials, applications, and challenges of ABMs in communication science.

It combines insights into norms and routines in digital newswork with an analytical approach from news diffusion research and the power of computational methods to track story-based news flows at high granularity of time intervals in comprehensive media samples. We ask how attributes of news stories and situational preconditions of their production help explain whether the variety of newsrooms in a digital journalism ecosystem will converge on immediate story coverage so that wide-range bursts will emerge at the start of news diffusion processes. Based on the reconstruction of 95 news diffusion processes among 28 professional online news sites in Germany, we pool first reports from diffusion processes with the same attribute and compare the dynamics of the accumulation of issued first reports by attributes in event history analyses. We find that most news factors made no difference in a recurring pattern of basically fast diffusion dynamics. Only negative news and stories involving prominent personalities further accelerated diffusion processes and spread even faster. In contrast, events characterized by wide reach beyond small groups and the production break of many newsrooms during the night slowed down digital diffusion.","[Buhl, Florian; Guenther, Elisabeth; Quandt, Thorsten] Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany",University of Munster,"Buhl, F (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Dept Commun, Munster, Germany.",florian.buhl@uni-muenster.de,"Quandt, Thorsten/ABE-4668-2021","Quandt, Thorsten/0000-0003-1937-0282; Buhl, Florian/0000-0002-4629-6869; Gunther, Elisabeth/0000-0001-5754-973X",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundeministerium fur Bildung und Forschung)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01UG1232A],This work was partially supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundeministerium fur Bildung und Forschung) under Grant 01UG1232A.,,37,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The emerging practice of structured journalism and its use of atomized news is described and is presented as an embodiment of the framework. Different approaches to the use of computation within journalism are then positioned as specific instances of that practice. This conception, analogous to semantic unit paradigms currently emerging in other information-centric domains, is then used to reinterpret several of journalism's urgent problems.

Different combinations of roles can produce characteristically different group outcomes, and thus can be either less or more productive with regard to collective goals. In online collaborative-learning environments, this can lead to better or worse learning outcomes for the individual participants. In this study, we propose and validate a novel approach for detecting emergent roles from participants' contributions and patterns of interaction. Specifically, we developed a group communication analysis (GCA) by combining automated computational linguistic techniques with analyses of the sequential interactions of online group communication. GCA was applied to three large collaborative interaction datasets (participant N = 2,429, group N = 3,598). Cluster analyses and linear mixed-effects modeling were used to assess the validity of the GCA approach and the influence of learner roles on student and group performance. The results indicated that participants' patterns of linguistic coordination and cohesion are representative of the roles that individuals play in collaborative discussions. More broadly, GCA provides a framework for researchers to explore the micro intra- and interpersonal patterns associated with participants' roles and the sociocognitive processes related to successful collaboration.","[Dowell, Nia M.

Based on media logic theory, we argue that the communication style of these messages is likely to be more interpersonal and subjective. To investigate this we used computational text analysis to compare status messages to headlines and leads, covering nine newspapers from the Netherlands and Flanders over a period of 2.5 years. We conclude that newspapers use status messages to add a subjective expression to news on social media, and call for research into how this takes shape and affects the audience.","[Welbers, Kasper] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Opgenhaffen, Michael] Univ Leuven, Inst Media Studies, Leuven, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; KU Leuven,"Welbers, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.welbers@vu.nl; michael.opgenhaffen@kuleuven.be,"Welbers, Kasper/D-2785-2016","Welbers, Kasper/0000-0003-2929-3815",,,,52,23,23,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Using standard text scaling techniques, we analyze partisanship in a novel dataset of more than 300,000 news articles produced by 644 journalists at 25 different US news outlets. We then develop a novel, semi-supervised model of partisanship of Twitter following relationships and show a modest correlation between the partisanship of whom a journalist follows on Twitter and the content she produces.

Italy is an interesting case for four different reasons: (1) to date, few analyses have been carried out on Mediterranean countries; (2) the Italian media system and its traditional journalism culture appear to be reluctant to innovate; (3) Italian data journalists are generally freelancers linked to small news agencies rather than established newsrooms; (4) the research reported in this paper was accomplished while the Italian government was approving a Freedom of Information Act. From the end of 2015 to the beginning of 2017, we carried out 15 interviews with data journalists working full-time for both established news organizations and specialized agencies. The findings show that data journalism in Italy is a highly professional sub-field, although journalistic education is not well developed. Data journalism is still largely determined by the availability and accessibility of public datasets. However, data journalists have developed certain strategies with which to generate and collect their own data, for instance collaborations and networks.","[Porlezza, Colin] Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England; [Splendore, Sergio] Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Milan, Italy",University of London; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Milan,"Porlezza, C (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Journalism, London, England.",colin.porlezza@city.ac.uk,,"SPLENDORE, SERGIO/0000-0001-5324-4496; Porlezza, Colin/0000-0002-1400-5879",,,,74,9,9,8,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

This article extends the literature on computational journalism by analysing two of the BBC's recent experiments in atomizing the news-an object-based approach, which seeks to make news more adaptable and scalable using media components that can be automatically and algorithmically combined in multiple ways. Findings suggest atomised news is viewed by the organisation as offering opportunities for greater efficiency and personalisation and sits within a broader turn towards structured journalism. We highlight three characteristics of atomisation-recording, recombining and reuse-to illustrate how it breaks from traditional approaches. We find journalists are writing for machines by converting unstructured information into structured data to enable automated recombination and future re-use of content. This impacts editorial control by delegating responsibility to either the algorithm or the audience, in the name of choice.

The results show that while journalists interested in data are highly educated in journalism or closely related fields, they do not have a strong level of education in the more technical areas of data journalism, such as data analysis, coding and data visualisation. The study further reveals that a high proportion of data journalism courses are concentrated in the United States, with a growing number of courses developing across the world, and particularly in Europe. Despite this, education in the field does not have a strong academic underpinning, and while many courses are emerging in this area, there are not enough academically trained instructors to lead and/or teach such interdisciplinary programmes in the higher education sector.","[Heravi, Bahareh R.] Univ Coll, Sch Informat & Commun Studies, Dublin, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Heravi, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Coll, Sch Informat & Commun Studies, Dublin, Ireland.",bahareh.heravi@ucd.ie,,"R.

But so far only a few investigative stories have utilized AI methods, in relatively narrow ways. This paper surveys what has been accomplished in investigative reporting using AI techniques, why it has been difficult to apply more advanced methods, and what sorts of investigative journalism problems might be solved by AI in the near term. Journalism problems are often unique to a particular story, which means that training data is not readily available and the cost of complex models cannot be amortized over multiple projects. Much of the data relevant to a story is not publicly accessible but in the hands of governments and private entities, often requiring collection, negotiation, or purchase. Journalistic inference requires very high accuracy, or extensive manual checking, to avoid the risk of libel. The factors that make some set of facts newsworthy are deeply sociopolitical and therefore difficult to encode computationally. The biggest near-term potential for AI in investigative journalism lies in data preparation tasks, such as data extraction from diverse documents and probabilistic cross-database record linkage.","[Stray, Jonathan] Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Columbia University,"Stray, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Grad Sch Journalism, New York, NY 10027 USA.",jonathan.stray@columbia.edu,,"Stray, Jonathan/0000-0003-4467-1239",,,,63,17,21,7,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Building on semi-structured interviews with editors of legacy news institutions in the United Kingdom and Germany, the study reveals the rationales behind the changing journalism-technology relationship and the dynamics of the re-articulation of the core ideals of journalism. In discussing automation with respect to strategic newsroom development, the interviewees see journalism's professional ideology as being in a state of flux. They identify contradictions between automation and some of journalism's core ideals (public service, autonomy, and objectivity) and acknowledge both the potential and limits of technology with regard to others (timeliness and ethics). Despite the growing relevance of automation for news production, human journalists are still regarded as the dominant agents in news production and its continuous reinvention. This human-still-in-the-loop perspective highlights the idea that journalism is undergoing a profound yet long transformation where new technologies are not simply appearing and changing everything, but are innovations developed and embedded in established relations of the news production process. This perspective both reiterates and challenges the prevailing meanings of journalism.","[Milosavljevic, Marko; Vobic, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Vobic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Social Sci, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",igor.vobic@fdv.uni-lj.si,,,"Slovenian Research Agency, ARRSSlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RSSlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia","This research was partly supported by the Slovenian Research Agency, ARRS; Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS.",,56,20,21,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The content analysis evaluates story characteristics linked to the concepts of transparency, interactivity, diversity, and information provenance. It finds that the data journalism produced by those outlets comes from small teams, focuses on hard news, provides fairly uncomplex data visualizations with low levels of interactivity, relies primarily on institutional sources and offers little original data collection, and incorporates just two data sources on average in a generally opaque manner. This leads to the conclusion that general data journalism still has a long way to go before it can live up to the optimism and idealization that characterizes much of the data turn in journalism. Instead, contemporary day-to-day data journalism is perhaps better characterized as evolutionary rather than revolutionary, with its celebrated potential to serve as a leap forward for journalism and engender greater trust in it remaining untapped.","[Zamith, Rodrigo] Univ Massachusetts, Journalism Dept, Integrat Learning Ctr S414, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Zamith, R (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Journalism Dept, Integrat Learning Ctr S414, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",rzamith@umass.edu,,"Zamith, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8114-1734",,,,66,25,25,10,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

A combined study of content analysis (n = 290) and semi-structured interviews with 20 Chinese media practitioners shows that despite enthusiasm for implementing this innovative form of journalism, it is only practiced at a cursory level with differences observed among traditional media, internet portals, and new media. While practitioners see clear advantages in data-driven sense-making and storytelling, there remains skepticism among those who doubt its compatibility with China's existing media system and have complexity concerns, or else are perplexed about its trialability in the context of a compressed innovation cycle. China's insufficient inheritance of quantitative reporting tradition and its long-held synthetic cognitive mode, together with the predicament of data availability and buffering tactics deployed by Chinese media to tackle uncertainties, all call into question how far data-driven journalistic innovation can extend its reach in the Chinese context.","[Zhang, Shuling; Feng, Jieyun] UIBE, Sch Int Studies, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,"Zhang, SL (通讯作者)，UIBE, Sch Int Studies, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",adazsl@126.com; fengjieyun88@126.com,,"Feng, Jieyun/0000-0003-0272-4304; Zhang, Shuling/0000-0002-3553-7276",China's Ministry of Education (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [16YJC860029]; Beijing Federation of Social Science Circles [2018QNRC07],This research was supported by a grant from China's Ministry of Education (MOE) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences (Project No. 16YJC860029) and from a grant from Beijing Federation of Social Science Circles (Project No. 2018QNRC07).,,31,15,15,4,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

By treating journalistic objectivity not as a stable referent, but as a contextual one prone to shifts in practices and understandings over time, it foregrounds how changing technologies of recording, creating, and distributing news content affect how journalistic objectivity is understood. Following this perspective, two technological practices are examined: photojournalism and algorithms. The development of photojournalism led to the prizing of news images as objective representations produced by the camera to the diminishment of human judgment. Similarly, the various outputs produced by news algorithms are accompanied by an orientation toward computational objectivity in contrast to human subjectivity. Exploring these dynamics sheds light on the ongoing relationship between news technologies and discourses of journalistic objectivity in the face of digital innovations in the production and circulation of news.","[Carlson, Matt] Univ Minnesota, Hubbard Sch Journalism & Mass Commun, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Carlson, M (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, 111 Murphy Hall,206 Church St SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",carlson1@umn.edu,,,,,,85,21,21,5,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

The discrepancy between scientific consensus and public's misperception calls for more dedicated public communication strategies to get climate change issues back on the front line of the public agenda. Based on the large-scale data acquired from the online knowledge community Quora, we conduct a computational linguistic analysis followed by the regression model to address the climate change communication from the agenda setting perspective. To be specific, our results find that certain narrative strategies may make climate change issues more salient by engaging public into discussion or evoking their long-term interest. Though scientific communicators have long been blaming lack of scientific literacy for low saliency of climate change issues, cognitive framework is proved to be least effective in raising public concern. Affective framework is relatively more influential in motivating people to participate in climate change discussion: the stronger the affective intensity is, the more prominent the issue is, but the affective polarity is not important. Perceptual framework is most powerful in promoting public discussion and the only variable that can significantly motivate the public's long-term desire to track issues, among which feeling plays the most critical role compared with seeing and hearing. This study extends existing science communication literature by shedding light on the role of previously ignored affective and perceptual frameworks in making issues salient and the conclusions may provide theoretical and practical implications for future climate change communication.","[Shi, Wen; Fu, Haohuan] Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wen; Fu, Haohuan] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Shi, Wen; Fu, Haohuan] JCGCS, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Chen, Changfeng] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xiong, Jie] Rennes Sch Business, Strategy & Mkt Dept, F-35065 Rennes, France",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University,"Fu, HH (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Earth Syst Modeling, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.; Fu, HH (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.; Fu, HH (通讯作者)，JCGCS, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",shiwensmile@163.com; fengchen5266@vip.163.com; jie.xiong@rennes-sb.com; haohuan@tsinghua.edu.cn,,"Shi, Wen/0000-0001-7057-6150","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFA0604500]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51761135015]; Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao)","This work was supported in part by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0604500), by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51761135015), and by the Center for High Performance Computing and System Simulation, Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao).",,145,2,2,10,28,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,44638,2019,11,6,,,,,,,1619,10.3390/su11061619,,,24,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HT1VV,WOS:000464353500002,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,44661

Our data measure students' personal characteristics and academic performance, as well as their social network information drawn from 4.5 million email correspon-dences among hundreds of students who were placed directly into leadership positions. After controlling for students' personal characteristics, work experience, and academic performance, we find that students' social networks strongly predict placement into leadership positions. For males, the higher a male student's centrality in the school-wide network, the higher his leadership-job placement will be. Men with network centrality in the top quartile have an expected job placement level that is 1.5 times greater than men in the bottom quartile of centrality. While centrality also predicts women's placement, high-placing women students have one thing more: an inner circle of predominantly female contacts who are connected to many nonoverlapping third-party contacts. Women with a network centrality in the top quartile and a female-dominated inner circle have an expected job placement level that is 2.5 times greater than women with low centrality and a male-dominated inner circle.

Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242 tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online.

Social networks that informally emerge within student communities can have an additional effect on their achievement. However, this effect of social ties is difficult to measure and quantify, because social networks are multidimensional and dynamically evolving within the educational context. We repeatedly surveyed a cohort of 226 engineering undergraduates between their first day at university and a crucial examination at the end of the academic year. We investigate how social networks emerge between previously unacquainted students and how integration in these networks explains academic success. Our study measures multiple important dimensions of social ties between students: their positive interactions, friendships, and studying relations. By using statistical models for dynamic network data, we are able to investigate the processes of social network formation in the cohort. We find that friendship ties informally evolve into studying relationships over the academic year. This process is crucial, as studying together with others, in turn, has a strong impact on students' success at the examination.

Indeed, the likelihood that readers will be exposed to and read given news articles is structured into news algorithms. Thus, ensuring that news algorithms uphold journalistic values is crucial. In this regard, the purpose of this paper is to quantify journalistic values to make them readable by algorithms through taking an exploratory approach to a question that has not been previously investigated. Design/methodology/approach The author matched the textual indices (extracted from natural language processing/automated content analysis) with human conceptions of journalistic values (derived from survey analysis) by implementing partial least squares path modeling. Findings The results suggest that the numbers of words or quotes news articles contain have a strong association with the survey respondent assessments of their balance, diversity, importance and factuality. Linguistic polarization was an inverse indicator of respondents' perception of balance, diversity and importance. While linguistic intensity was useful for gauging respondents' perception of sensationalism, it was an ineffective indicator of importance and factuality. The numbers of adverbs and adjectives were useful for estimating respondents' perceptions of factuality and sensationalism. In addition, the greater numbers of quotes, pair quotes and exclamation/question marks in news headlines were associated with respondents' perception of lower journalistic values. The author also found that the assessment of journalistic values influences the perception of news credibility. Research limitations/implications - This study has implications for computational journalism, credibility research and news algorithm development. Originality/value - It represents the first attempt to quantify human conceptions of journalistic values with textual indices.","[Choi, Sujin] Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Choi, S (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",sujinchoi2012@gmail.com,"Choi, Sujin/AAH-9255-2020","Choi, Sujin/0000-0002-7665-0734",Kyung Hee University [KHU-20180926],"This work was supported by a grant from Kyung Hee University in 2018 (KHU-20180926).

High support of the favored opinion in the social environment is treated as a positive feedback which reinforces the value associated to this opinion. In connected networks of sufficiently high modularity, different groups of agents can form strong convictions of competing opinions. Linking the social feedback process to standard equilibrium concepts we analytically characterize sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization. While previous models have emphasized the polarization effects of deliberative argument-based communication, our model highlights an affective experience-based route to polarization, without assumptions about negative influence or bounded confidence.","[Banisch, S.; Olbrich, E.] Max Planck Inst Math Sci, Inselstr 22, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Banisch, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Math Sci, Inselstr 22, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",sven.banisch@UniVerseCity.de,"Olbrich, Eckehard/A-2339-2010","Olbrich, Eckehard/0000-0002-3987-1271",European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [732942],"This project has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 732942 (www.Odycceus.eu).

We build a new crowd-sourced Twitter corpus that contains the posts of 464 users along with their grit scores, and explore how grit correlates with other major behavioural and personality traits.

Such a task demands both an understanding of the epistemological challenge posed by the Big Data phenomenon and a critical assessment of the offers and promises coming from the area of Big Data analytics. This paper draws upon the critical social and data scientists' view on Big Data as an epistemological challenge that stems not only from the sheer volume of digital data but, predominantly, from the proliferation of the narrow-technological and the positivist views on data. Adoption of the social-scientific epistemological stance presupposes that digital data was conceptualised as manifestations of the social. In order to answer the epistemological challenge, social scientists need to extend the repertoire of social scientific theories and conceptual frameworks that may inform the analysis of the social in the age of Big Data. However, an 'epistemological revolution' discourse on Big Data may hinder the integration of the social scientific knowledge into the Big Data analytics.","[Resnyansky, Lucy] Def Sci & Technol Grp, NSID, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Defence Science & Technology,"Resnyansky, L (通讯作者)，POB 1500, Edinburgh, SA 5111, Australia.",Lucy.Resnyansky@dst.defence.gov.au,,"Resnyansky, Lucy/0000-0003-0583-8163",,,,100,11,12,5,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,44598,2019,6,1,,,,,,,2.05395E+15,10.1177/2053951718823815,,,12,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,HL3XU,WOS:000458650200001,,gold,,,44661

Overall, we find that it is useful to consider the recency of Twitter posts while using it to predict a real outcome, such as an election result. Sentiment information mined using machine learning models was the most accurate predictor of election outcomes. Social network information is stable despite sudden surges in political discussions, for e.g. around elections-related news events. Methods combining sentiment and volume information, or sentiment and social network information, are effective at predicting smaller vote shares, for e.g. vote shares in the case of independent candidates and regional parties.

Bots are one form of algorithmic technology that has found a place in the modern newsroom, with chatbots leading the way as news organisations seek to attract new audiences using conversational forms of journalism. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (Al) and machine teaming (ML) have fuelled increasing experimentation with machine autonomy and there has been much hyperbole in the press about the extent and impact of this on journalism. Looking at on-the-ground trials in audience-facing bots at the UK's largest public broadcaster, we find a significantly more restricted picture. News bots at The BBC to-date have been basic, do not use ML, and have rarely been integrated into news production. The organisation is laying groundwork for development of more interactive news formats with an increasingly conversational tone and individual mode of address as part of a strategy for increased personalisation, which is likely to involve growing levels of ML In the process, bots are reconfiguring working practices and infrastructure, posing new editorial and technical challenges, and redefining relationships with audiences.

As a first step to improve scientific access to large communication data, this article systematizes the data acquisition options and outlines their specific advantages and barriers based on a qualitative interview study with 22 researchers in the field of CCS. Three overarching themes are identified that seem to determine the resulting data quality of all data collection methods.

High general collective intelligence is achieved when a group performs well across a wide variety of tasks. A number of factors have been shown to be predictive of general collective intelligence, but there is sparse formal theory explaining the presence of correlations across tasks, betraying a fundamental gap in our understanding of what general collective intelligence is measuring. Here, we formally argue that general collective intelligence arises from groups achieving commitment to group goals, accurate shared beliefs, and coordinated actions. We then argue for the existence of generic mechanisms that help groups achieve these cognitive alignment conditions. The presence or absence of such mechanisms can potentially explain observed correlations in group performance across tasks. Under our view, general collective intelligence can be conceived as measuring group performance on classes of tasks that have particular combinations of cognitive alignment requirements.","[Krafft, Peter M.] MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Krafft, PM (通讯作者)，MIT, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",pkrafft@csail.mit.edu,,,NSF GRFPNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD) [1122374],"This work was supported in part by the NSF GRFP under grant no. 1122374.

The emergence of online social media has enabled access to data regarding people relationships at a large scale. Twitter, specifically, is an information oriented network, with users sharing and consuming information. In this work, we study whether users tend to be in contact with people interested in similar topics, i.e., if they are topically aligned. To do so, we propose an approach based on the use of hashtags to extract information topics from Twitter messages and model users' interests. Our results show that, on average, users are connected with other users similar to them. Furthermore, we show that topical alignment provides interesting information that can eventually allow inferring users' connectivity.

The latter leaves massive traces of data and thereby opens opportunities to acquire a better understanding of social communities in general. In this work, we are particularly interested in the patterns of volunteer efforts within the communities. To that end, we examine the community structure of several large online question-answer sites and how they evolve over time. To describe the user interaction patterns concisely, we employ the hyperbolic community model. This statistical model allows for a summary of each community in each time step by means of intuitive parameters that reflect the connectivity pattern within the network. Our study of the temporal evolution of these parameters reveals an important characteristic: In contrast to what has been observed earlier in the analyses of growth behaviour of online communities, we observe that the user activity within a community is constant with respect to its size throughout its lifetime. Furthermore, the structural organisation of different communities across different question-answer sites seems to follow a common scheme: There is a small group of users who is responsible for the majority of the social interactions.","[Metzler, Saskia] Max Planck Inst Informat, Saarland Informat Campus,Bldg E1-4, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany; [Guennemann, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Dept Informat, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Guennemann, Stephan] Tech Univ Munich, Inst Adv Study, Boltzmannstr 3, D-85748 Garching, Germany; [Miettinen, Pauli] Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Comp, POB 1627, Kuopio 70211, Finland",Max Planck Society; Technical University of Munich; Technical University of Munich; University of Eastern Finland,"Metzler, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Informat, Saarland Informat Campus,Bldg E1-4, D-66123 Saarbrucken, Germany.",saskia.metzler@mpi-inf.mpg.de,,"Miettinen, Pauli/0000-0003-2271-316X",,,,49,3,3,0,13,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-8733,1879-2111,,SOC NETWORKS,Soc.

In this study, six different computational (i.e. Natural Language Processing) and spatiotemporal analytical approaches were implemented to assess the relevance of risk information extracted from tweets obtained during the 2013 Colorado flood event. Primarily, tweets containing information about the flooding events and its impacts were analysed. Examination of the relationships between tweet volume and its content with precipitation amount, damage extent, and official reports revealed that relevant tweets provided information about the event and its impacts rather than any other risk information that public expects to receive via alert messages. However, only 14% of the geo-tagged tweets and only 0.06% of the total fire hose tweets were found to be relevant to the event. By providing insight into the quality of social media data and its usefulness to emergency management activities, this study contributes to the literature on quality of big data. Future research in this area would focus on assessing the reliability of relevant tweets for disaster related situational awareness.","[Liu, Xiaohui] Dalhousie Univ, Resilience Res Ctr, 6420 Coburg Rd, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada; [Kar, Bandana] Oak Ridge Natl Lab, Urban Dynam Inst, Computat Sci & Engn Div, Oak Ridge, TN USA; [Zhang, Chaoyang] Univ Southern Mississippi, Sch Comp, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA; [Cochran, David M.] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Geog & Geol, Hattiesburg, MS 39406 USA",Dalhousie University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Oak Ridge National Laboratory; University of Southern Mississippi; University of Southern Mississippi,"Liu, XH (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Resilience Res Ctr, 6420 Coburg Rd, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",xiaohuiliugis@gmail.com,,"Liu, Xiaohui/0000-0002-4161-0388; Cochran, David/0000-0003-3916-5550; Kar, Bandana/0000-0002-0510-658X",National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [CMMI-1335187]; Department of Homeland Security ContractUnited States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [HSHQDC-12-C-00057]; Department of Geography and Geology at The University of Southern Mississippi,"This research was funded partially by the National Science Foundation [grant no CMMI-1335187], the Department of Homeland Security Contract [grant no HSHQDC-12-C-00057], and the 2014, 2015, and 2016 Arthell Kelley Scholarships from the Department of Geography and Geology at The University of Southern Mississippi.",,63,7,7,4,21,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-8947,1753-8955,,INT J DIGIT EARTH,Int.

This article examines such developments via a quantitative content analysis of personalisation features at 15 major news outlets in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany and via interviews with senior editorial staff at some of those outlets. Both websites and mobile apps were studied, allowing comparisons to be made across platforms as well as geographically. Longitudinal comparisons were also made against an equivalent survey conducted in 2010. The results reveal significant changes over the last six years with, for example, rises in personalisation on mobile platforms, falls in the use of recommendations by friends, and convergence and commodification in content recommendation platforms. This study provides evidence to support continued debates on classical concerns such as selective exposure, but also raises new concerns about the effects of personalisation, including data protection and security issues.","[Kunert, Jessica] Univ Hamburg, Journalism & Commun Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Thurman, Neil] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Commun Studies & Media Res, Munich, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Munich,"Kunert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Journalism & Commun Sci, Hamburg, Germany.",Jessica.Kunert@uni-hamburg.de,,"Kunert, Jessica/0000-0001-6370-1558",Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen [A110823/88171],The work was supported by a research grant from the Volkswagen Foundation [grant number A110823/88171].,,45,10,10,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.

This article addresses the nature and the characteristics of spam profiles in a social network like Twitter to improve spam detection, based on a number of publicly available language-independent features. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these features in spam detection, four datasets are extracted for four different language contexts (i.e. Arabic, English, Korean and Spanish), and a fifth is formed by combining them all. We conduct our experiments using a set of five well-known classification algorithms in spam detection field, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) (J48) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, along with five filter-based feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain, Chi-square, ReliefF, Correlation and Significance. The results show oscillating performance of each classifier across all datasets, but improved classification results with feature selection. In addition, detailed analysis and comparisons are carried out on two different levels: in the first level, we compare the selected features' importance among the feature selection methods, whereas in the second level, we observe the relations and the importance of the selected features across all datasets. The findings of this article lead to a better understanding of social spam and improving detection methods by considering the various important features resulting from the different lingual contexts.","[Al-Zoubi, Ala' M.; Faris, Hossam; Alqatawna, Ja'far; Hassonah, Mohammad A.] Univ Jordan, King Abdullah II Sch Informat Technol, POB 11942, Amman, Jordan; [Alqatawna, Ja'far] Higher Coll Technol, Comp Informat Sci Div, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates",University of Jordan; Higher Colleges of Technology - United Arab Emirates,"Al-Zoubi, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Jordan, King Abdullah II Sch Informat Technol, POB 11942, Amman, Jordan.",alaah14@gmail.com,"Faris, Hossam/C-2392-2015; Al-Zoubi, Ala'/S-8745-2016","Faris, Hossam/0000-0003-4261-8127; Al-Zoubi, Ala'/0000-0003-0414-3570",,,,75,14,14,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0165-5515,1741-6485,,J INF SCI,J.

Such social threat, or fear, learning can have dramatic consequences, as manifested in acute stress symptoms and maladaptive fears. However, most research has so far focused on socially acquired threat responses that are expressed as increased arousal rather than active behavior. In three experiments (n = 120), we examined the effect of indirect experiences on behaviors by establishing a link between social threat learning and instrumental decision making. We contrasted learning from direct experience (i.e., Pavlovian conditioning) (experiment 1) against two common forms of social threat learning-social observation (experiment 2) and verbal instruction (experiment 3)-and how this learning transferred to subsequent instrumental decision making using behavioral experiments and computational modeling. We found that both types of social threat learning transfer to decision making in a strong and surprisingly inflexible manner. Notably, computational modeling indicated that the transfer of observational and instructed threat learning involved different computational mechanisms. Our results demonstrate the strong influence of others' expressions of fear on one's own decisions and have important implications for understanding both healthy and pathological human behaviors resulting from the indirect exposure to threatening events.","[Lindstrom, Bjorn] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Social Psychol, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lindstrom, Bjorn; Tobler, Philippe N.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland; [Lindstrom, Bjorn; Golkar, Armita; Jangard, Simon; Olsson, Andreas] Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Sect Psychol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden; [Golkar, Armita] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Clin Psychol, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; University of Zurich; Karolinska Institutet; University of Amsterdam,"Lindstrom, B (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Social Psychol, NL-1018 WT Amsterdam, Netherlands.; Lindstrom, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Lab Social & Neural Syst Res, CH-8001 Zurich, Switzerland.; Lindstrom, B (通讯作者)，Karolinska Inst, Dept Clin Neurosci, Sect Psychol, S-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",bjorn.r.lindstrom@gmail.com,,,"Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [KAW 2014.0237]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond Grant [P11-1017]; European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [284366]; Forte Grant [COFAS2: 2014-2785 FOIP]; Swedish Research CouncilSwedish Research CouncilEuropean Commission [2015-00312]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)European Commission [100014_165884, 100019_176016]","We thank Marc Guitart-Masip, Ida Selbing, and Philip Parnamets for comments on an earlier version of the manuscript and Tove Hensler, Diana Diaz Del Castillo, and Erik Enstrom for help with data collection.

However, performing a qualitative analysis across a massive social media data set is cumbersome and impractical. Instead, researchers often extract a subset of content to analyze, but a framework to facilitate this process is currently lacking. We present a four-phased framework for improving this extraction process, which blends the capacities of data science techniques to compress large data sets into smaller spaces, with the capabilities of qualitative analysis to address research questions. We demonstrate this framework by investigating the topics of Australian Twitter commentary on climate change, using quantitative (non-negative matrix inter-joint factorization; topic alignment) and qualitative (thematic analysis) techniques. Our approach is useful for researchers seeking to perform qualitative analyses of social media, or researchers wanting to supplement their quantitative work with a qualitative analysis of broader social context and meaning.","[Andreotta, Matthew; Hurlstone, Mark J.; Farrell, Simon] Univ Western Australia, Sch Psychol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Andreotta, Matthew; Nugroho, Robertus; Paris, Cecile] CSIRO, Data61, Corner Vimiera & Pembroke St, Marsfield, NSW 2122, Australia; [Nugroho, Robertus] Soegijapranata Catholic Univ, Fac Comp Sci, Semarang, Indonesia; [Boschetti, Fabio] Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, CSIRO, Ocean & Atmosphere, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Walker, Iain] Univ Canberra, Sch Psychol & Counselling, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of Western Australia; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Soegijapranata Catholic University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); University of Western Australia; University of Canberra,"Andreotta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Psychol Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.; Andreotta, M (通讯作者)，CSIRO, Data61, Corner Vimiera & Pembroke St, Marsfield, NSW 2122, Australia.",matthew.andreotta@research.uwa.edu.au; askrobertus@gmail.com; mark.hurlstone@uwa.edu.au; Fabio.Boschetti@csiro.au; simon.farrell@uwa.edu.au; Cecile.Paris@csiro.au,"Nugroho, Robertus/AAU-4750-2021; Nugroho, Robertus S/B-2045-2014; Boschetti, Fabio/A-1607-2015; Walker, Iain/G-5457-2010; Paris, Cecile/C-2334-2011; Farrell, Simon/H-3266-2011","Nugroho, Robertus/0000-0003-2442-4185; Nugroho, Robertus S/0000-0003-2442-4185; Boschetti, Fabio/0000-0001-8999-6913; Walker, Iain/0000-0002-1020-5873; Andreotta, Matthew/0000-0002-2996-6031; Paris, Cecile/0000-0003-3816-0176; Hurlstone, Mark/0000-0001-9920-6284; Farrell, Simon/0000-0001-7452-8789",Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship from the University of Western Australia; CSIRO Research OfficeCommonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Climate Adaptation Flagship of the CSIRO,"This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship from the University of Western Australia and a scholarship from the CSIRO Research Office awarded to the first author, and a grant from the Climate Adaptation Flagship of the CSIRO awarded to the third and sixth authors.

This method uses machine learning models to predict user adoption behavior, uses simulation to infer unobservable potential outcomes, and uses a counterfactual framework to identify individual-level social influence. The method also uses an adjusting strategy to reduce the effect of homophily and correlated unobservables. Empirical results obtained on a synthetic dataset and a semi-synthetic dataset show that the proposed method performs better on causal inference at the individual and aggregate levels than competitive methods. The computational experiment using a real-world database considers three applications, i.e., new product adoption, repeated purchase and cross selling. The empirical results show that the proposed method performs well on identifying influential members. The results reveal that the global hubs and local central nodes of the versatile friend circles have similar influences on the adoption behavior of the followers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Users share information of their interest on various social media without their trustworthiness verification. Therefore, SN are susceptible to malicious users for misinformation spreading. In SN, the original information source is generally unknown and the user who is sharing the contents is the only known information about the source. Therefore, the users trustworthiness is an effective criterion for SN contents trustworthiness estimation. However, the users are unable to identify trustworthy/untrustworthy users, and the existing user-user/item relationship models do not provide user trustworthiness information. Our proposed model provides a systematic way to assess the user trustworthiness based on user attributes and interaction behavior. The proposed model is helpful to avoid the trust sparsity (implicit trust model), trust subjectivity (users objective/collective trustworthiness estimation model) and cold-start users trustworthiness (users attributes-based trust modeling) problems. We employ friends-recommendation (FR) as an exemplary application to evaluate the performance of our proposed model in trust-aware recommendations. Simulation results illustrate that our trust-aware FR model outperformed the existing trust and FR models.","[Khan, Jebran; Lee, Sungchang] Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Informat & Commun, Goyang 10540, South Korea",Korea Aerospace University,"Lee, S (通讯作者)，Korea Aerosp Univ, Dept Informat & Commun, Goyang 10540, South Korea.",sclee@kau.ac.kr,"Khan, Jebran/AAB-7446-2020","Khan, Jebran/0000-0002-9971-1149; Lee, Sungchang/0000-0002-4698-6018",Basic Science Research Programs through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2017R1A2B1010817],This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Programs through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education under Grant NRF-2017R1A2B1010817.,,67,2,2,2,6,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,142826,142842,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2943877,,,17,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JN8QJ,WOS:000497156000217,,gold,,,44661

Inspired from the sensorimotor mechanisms of the primate brain, object affordances are utilized for both intention estimation and action execution, in particular, to generate altruistic behavior. At the core of the model is the notion that sensorimotor systems developed for movement generation can be used to process the visual stimuli generated by actions of the others, infer the goals behind, and take the necessary actions to help achieving these goals, potentially leading to the emergence of altruistic behavior. Therefore, we argue that altruistic behavior is not necessarily a consequence of deliberate cognitive processing but may emerge through basic sensorimotor processes such as error minimization, that is, minimizing the difference between the observed and expected outcomes. In the model, affordances also play a key role by constraining the possible set of actions that an observed actor might be engaged in, enabling a fast and accurate intention inference. The model components are implemented on an upper-body humanoid robot. A set of experiments are conducted validating the workings of the components of the model, such as affordance extraction and task execution. Significantly, to assess how human partners interact with our altruistic model deployed robot, extensive experiments with naive subjects are conducted. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model can explain emergent altruistic behavior in reference to its biological counterpart and moreover engage human partners to exploit this behavior when implemented on an anthropomorphic robot.","[Imre, Mert; Ugur, Emre] Bogazici Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey; [Imre, Mert; Nagai, Yukie] Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Oztop, Erhan] Ozyegin Univ, Comp Sci Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Bogazici University; National Institute of Information & Communications Technology (NICT) - Japan; Ozyegin University,"Ugur, E (通讯作者)，Bogazici Univ, Dept Comp Engn, TR-34342 Istanbul, Turkey.",emre.ugur@boun.edu.tr,"Ugur, Emre/A-6011-2017","Ugur, Emre/0000-0001-9597-2731; Nagai, Yukie/0000-0003-4794-0940; , mert/0000-0003-1749-9365",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [731761]; JST CREST Cognitive Mirroring: Assisting people with developmental disorders by means of self-understanding and social sharing of cognitive processes'' [JPMJCR16E2]; Bogazici Research Fund (BAP) project IMAGINE-COG++ [18A01P5],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement no. 731761, IMAGINE; JST CREST Cognitive Mirroring: Assisting people with developmental disorders by means of self-understanding and social sharing of cognitive processes'' (Grant Number: JPMJCR16E2); and Bogazici Research Fund (BAP) project IMAGINE-COG++ (Grant Number: 18A01P5).",,38,2,2,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1059-7123,1741-2633,,ADAPT BEHAV,Adapt.

A popular source of information for personalization is social networks of users. In this paper, we aim at proposing a social-network-based personalized information retrieval (PIR) method that: i) is holistic (not just considering some local neighborhood of the searcher); ii) is efficient in term of computational/storage cost; iii) its personalization component has a probabilistic basis. To the best of our knowledge, no such method exists. We propose an interestedness measure and several variations of it for quantifying the interestedness of each user in another user based on a social network of users. The general idea is to try to mimic a searcher's behavior in the real world to estimate the interestedness. The measures are then exploited to personalize the retrieval results. We evaluate the resulting PIR methods and compare them in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational/storage cost. We also compare them with some baseline methods. In summary, our analyses suggest that retrieval based on at least one of the measures performs well in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational/storage cost.","[Tabrizi, Shayan A.; Shakery, Azadeh; Asadpour, Masoud] Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 1439957131, Iran; [Shakery, Azadeh] Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Sch Comp Sci, Tehran 1953833511, Iran; [Tavallaei, Mohammad Ali] Univ Tehran, Inst Appl Intelligent Syst, Tehran 1418814751, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran,"Shakery, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Coll Engn, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Tehran 1439957131, Iran.; Shakery, A (通讯作者)，Inst Res Fundamental Sci IPM, Sch Comp Sci, Tehran 1953833511, Iran.",shakery@ut.ac.ir,"Tabrizi, Shayan A./AAU-1371-2021","Tabrizi, Shayan A./0000-0001-6839-8930","School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences [CS1398-4-223]","This work was supported in part by the Grant from the School of Computer Science, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences, under Grant CS1398-4-223.",,42,1,1,1,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,119332,119349,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2935425,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",,Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,KF6PM,WOS:000509361700002,,gold,,,44661

Building upon recent conceptual and methodological developments in framing research, we introduce a new approach, the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN). We demonstrate the applicability of our method in case studies where framing theory is developed and fairly consistent, and in exploratory ones where it is not, using three diverse U.S. news corpora: the coverage of political candidates in Senate races (n = 8,337 articles), foreign nations (n = 18,216), and infectious diseases and epidemics (n = 5,005).

In the present study, we aimed to build on this work and demonstrate that there is a large and systematic bias in the use of personal names in the natural-language environment, such that male names are much more prevalent than female names. This bias holds over an analysis of billions of words of text, subcategorized into different genres within fiction novels, nonfiction books, and subtitles from television and film. Additionally, we showed that this bias holds across time, with more recent work displaying the same patterns as work published tens or hundreds of years previously. Finally, we showed that the main cause of the bias comes from male authors perpetuating the bias toward male names, with female authors showing a much smaller bias.

In the current work, we propose a model that suggests that negative self-stereotypes can theoretically be accounted for by the need to communicate in a social system made up by groups with unequal power. Because our theory is dynamic, probabilistic, and interactionist, we use a computational simulation technique to show that the proposed model is able to reproduce the phenomenon of interest, to provide novel accounts of related phenomena, and to suggest novel empirical predictions. We describe our computational model, our variables' dynamic behavior and interactions, and link our analyses to the literature on stereotypes and self-stereotypes, the stability of stereotypes (in particular, gender and racial stereotypes), the effects of power asymmetries, and the effects of intergroup contact.","[Lagos, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Programa Magister Bioestadist, Santiago, Chile; [Canessa, Enrique; Chaigneau, Sergio E.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Psychol, Ctr Cognit Res CINCO, Santiago, Chile; [Chaigneau, Sergio E.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Sch Psychol, Ctr Social & Cognit Neurosci, Santiago, Chile; [Canessa, Enrique] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Fac Engn & Sci, Vina Del Mar, Chile",Universidad de Chile; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Chaigneau, SE (通讯作者)，Av Presidente Errazuriz 3328, Santiago, Chile.",sergio.chaigneau@uai.cl,"Chaigneau, Sergio/AAG-6105-2020","Chaigneau, Sergio/0000-0001-8642-6325; Lagos, Rodrigo/0000-0002-5806-6227; Canessa, Enrique/0000-0002-4931-5025",Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y TecnologicoComision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT [1150074],"Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientifico y Tecnologico, Grant/Award Number: 1150074",,97,0,0,1,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8308,1468-5914,,J THEOR SOC BEHAV,J.

Our research demonstrates that these existing tools allow social science research to make theory-solid approaches to understand the role of image circulation in creating and sustaining national and transnational networks on social media, and show how national-populist thinking is spread through images that catalyse and mobilise affects - fear, anger and resentment - thus creating an effective affective economy.","[Hokka, Jenni] Tampere Univ, Fac Commun Sci, Tampere, Finland; [Nelimarkka, Matti] Univ Helsinki, Fac Social Sci, Ctr Res Methods, Helsinki, Finland; [Nelimarkka, Matti] Aalto Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Digital Content Communities Res Grp, Espoo, Finland",Tampere University; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; Aalto University,"Hokka, J (通讯作者)，Tampere Univ, Fac Informat Technol & Commun Sci ITC, FI-33014 Tampere, Finland.",jenni.hokka@tuni.fi,,"Nelimarkka, Matti/0000-0001-9867-692X",Academy of FinlandAcademy of Finland,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the Academy of Finland.",,80,8,8,10,47,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAY,2020,22,5,,,,,770,792,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444819868686,,43678,23,Communication,,Communication,LG6WH,WOS:000482579700001,,Green Accepted,,,44661

This has fueled a debate about the ways (if any) changes to the nature of our information networks might be affecting voters' beliefs about the world, voting results, and, ultimately, democracy. At the same time, much discussion in the public arena in recent years has concerned the notion that ill-informed voters have been voting against their own self-interest. The research reported here brings these two strands together: simulations involving agent-based models, interpreted through the formal framework of Condorcet's (1785) jury theorem, demonstrate how changes to information networks may make voter error more likely, even though individual competence has largely remained unchanged. In recent years, the receipt and the perception of information has changed in ways which have fueled fears about the fates of our democracies. However, real information on these possibilities or the direction of these changes does not exist. Into this gap, Hahn and colleagues bring the power of Condorcet's (1785) Jury Theorem to show that changes in our information networks have affected voter inter-dependence so that it is likely that voters are now collectively more ignorant even if individual voter competence remains unchanged.","[Hahn, Ulrike] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England; [von Sydow, Momme; Merdes, Christoph] Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Munich, Germany",University of London; Birkbeck University London; University of Munich,"Hahn, U (通讯作者)，Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Psychol Sci, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",u.hahn@bbk.ac.uk,"Hahn, Ulrike/A-8947-2010","Hahn, Ulrike/0000-0002-7744-8589",Humboldt Foundation's Anneliese Meier Research Award,"This paper is based on work presented at the 40th Cognitive Science Conference 2018 in Madison, WI, (US) (Hahn, von Sydow, & Merdes, 2018) and was awarded the conference's Computational Modeling Prize in Applied Cognition.

Along with the demographic data, we collected self-reported assessments on validated psychometric questionnaires for moral traits and basic human values, and combined this information with passively collected multi-modal digital data from web browsing behaviour and smartphone usage. A machine learning framework was then designed to infer both the demographic and psychological attributes from the behavioural data. In a cross-validated setting, our models predicted demographic attributes with good accuracy as measured by the weighted AUROC score (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic), but were less performant for the moral traits and human values. These results call for further investigation, since they are still far from unveiling individual? psychological fabric. This connection, along with the most predictive features that we provide for each attribute, might prove useful for designing personalised services, communication strategies, and interventions, and can be used to sketch a portrait of people with similar worldview.","[Kalimeri, Kyriaki; Beiro, Mariano G.; Delfino, Matteo; Cattuto, Ciro] ISI Fdn, Data Sci Lab, Turin, Italy; [Beiro, Mariano G.] Univ Buenos Aires, CONICET, INTECIN, Fac Ingn, Caba, Argentina; [Raleigh, Robert] PathSight Predict Sci Inc, New York, NY USA",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); University of Buenos Aires,"Kalimeri, K (通讯作者)，ISI Fdn, Data Sci Lab, Turin, Italy.",kalimeri@ieee.org,"Kalimeri, Kyriaki/F-2360-2010","Kalimeri, Kyriaki/0000-0001-8068-5916; Beiro, Mariano/0000-0002-5474-0309",Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation - Fondazione CRT,The authors acknowledge support from the Lagrange Project of the ISI Foundation funded by the Fondazione CRT.

Our analysis shows that the strongest driver of romantic interaction at the national level is simple geographic proximity, but at the local level, other demographic factors come into play. We find that dating markets in each city are partitioned into submarkets along lines of age and ethnicity. Sex ratio varies widely between submarkets, with younger submarkets having more men and fewer women than older ones. There is also a noticeable tendency for minorities, especially women, to be younger than the average in older submarkets, and our analysis reveals how this kind of racial stratification arises through the messaging decisions of both men and women. Our study illustrates how network techniques applied to online interactions can reveal the aggregate effects of individual behavior on social structure.","[Bruch, Elizabeth E.] Univ Michigan, Dept Sociol, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Bruch, Elizabeth E.; Newman, M.

The Internet provides vast opportunities for individuals to present themselves in different ways, from simple self-enhancement to malicious identity fraud. We often rely on our Internet-based judgments of others to make decisions, such as whom to socialize with, date, or employ. Recently, personality-perception researchers have turned to studying social media and digital devices in order to ask whether a person's digital traces can reveal aspects of his or her identity. Simultaneously, advances in big data analytics have demonstrated that computer algorithms can predict individuals' traits from their digital traces. In this article, we address three questions: What do we currently know about human- and computer-based personality assessments? How accurate are these assessments? Where are these fields heading?

People can share their views and can visit other's opinion about the particular material, news, products, artifacts and, trends, etc. anywhere, anytime, and anywhere. An Opinion leader is a critical person who can change, modify and transform other's view by their knowledge and proficiency. In this article, an innovative approach is proposed to discover the top-N local and global opinion leader within the community and social network respectively. Initially, we identified the community structure within the social network using the modified Louvain method and next identified the opinion leader using a modified firefly algorithm in each community. We also determined the global opinion leader within the same social network using the same firefly algorithm. The proposed approach is exceptionally supportive to expert and intelligent system because it competently discovered the local optimum concurrently in each subgroup of the social network. All the users can update its attractiveness value without any supposition, and as soon as the distance among the user's increases, the other users can automatically create another subgroup in the network and form the local community. In addition, as the population size in the network increases, the entire users measure their prominence simultaneously. Therefore, there is no consequence on computational time and accuracy of the algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm Is superlative suitable for discovering the opinion leader in the local community and globally in the social network. For legalized the proposed approach, we implemented our proposed method on synthesized as well as on real dataset. Finally, we concluded that both the recommended procedures are much better concerning the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score with the widely used standard Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures.

However, despite long-standing interest, the evolution of social complexity is still poorly understood. This may be due in part to researchers focusing on the feasibility of quantifying aspects of sociality, rather than what features are characteristic of animal social complexity in the first place. Any given approach to studying complexity can tell us some things about animal sociality, but may miss others, so it is critical to decide first how to conceptualize complexity before jumping in to quantifying it. Here, we briefly summarize five existing approaches to measuring social complexity. Then, we highlight three fundamental concepts that are commonly used in the field of complex systems: (1) scales of organization, (2) compression and (3) emergence. All of these concepts are applicable to the study of animal social systems, but are not often explicitly addressed in existing social complexity measures. We discuss how these concepts can provide a rigorous foundation for conceptualizing social complexity, the potential benefits of incorporating them and how existing measures do (or do not) include them. Ultimately, researchers need to critically evaluate any measure of animal social complexity in order to balance the biological relevance of the aspect of sociality they are quantifying with the feasibility of obtaining enough data.

Because physical and virtual spaces have become increasingly intertwined due to location-aware mobile devices, we propose extending the concept of linguistic landscape to cover both physical and virtual environments. To cope with the high volume of social media data, we adopt computational methods for studying the richness and diversity of the virtual linguistic landscape, namely, automatic language identification and topic modelling, together with diversity indices commonly used in ecology and information sciences. We illustrate the proposed approach in a case study covering nearly 120,000 posts uploaded on Instagram over 4.5 years at the Senate Square in Helsinki, Finland. Our analysis reveals the richness and diversity of the virtual linguistic landscape, which is also shown to be susceptible to continuous change.","[Hiippala, Tuomo] Univ Helsinki, Dept Languages, Helsinki, Finland; [Hiippala, Tuomo; Hausmann, Anna; Tenkanen, Henrikki; Toivonen, Tuuli] Univ Helsinki, Digital Geog Lab, Helsinki, Finland; [Hiippala, Tuomo; Hausmann, Anna; Tenkanen, Henrikki; Toivonen, Tuuli] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Hausmann, Anna; Tenkanen, Henrikki; Toivonen, Tuuli] Univ Helsinki, Dept Geog & Geosci, Helsinki, Finland",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Helsinki,"Hiippala, T (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, POB 24, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",tuomo.hiippala@helsinki.fi,"Hiippala, Tuomo/F-1088-2013; Tenkanen, Henrikki/N-2183-2019","Tenkanen, Henrikki/0000-0002-0918-4710; Toivonen, Tuuli/0000-0002-6625-4922; Hausmann, Anna/0000-0002-9639-9532; Hiippala, Tuomo/0000-0002-8504-9422",Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science; Kone Foundation,This work was supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation and the Kone Foundation.,,57,9,9,15,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2055-7671,2055-768X,,DIGIT SCHOLARSH HUM,Digit.

The methodology developed a computational assessment tool based on the Multiple Correspondence Analysis and the framework for vulnerability analysis in sustainable science. This approach uses participatory mapping and on-site data. The data collection was easily implemented with free software tools to facilitate its use in low-income urban territories. The method combines the evaluation of experts using the of the traditional approach for the qualification of the variables of vulnerability in its three components (exposure, susceptibility, and resilience), and incorporates a computational method of the correspondence analysis family to formulate the indicators of vulnerability. The results showed that the multiple correspondence analysis is useful for the identification of the most representative variables in the vulnerability assessment, used for the construction of spatial disaggregated vulnerability indicators and therefore the development of vulnerability maps that will help in the short term in disaster risk management, urban planning, and infrastructure protection. In addition, the variables of the susceptibility component are the most representative regardless of the type of flooding, followed by the variables of the exposure component, for sudden flood-prone territories, and the resilience component for slow flood-prone territories. Our findings and the computational tool can facilitate the prioritization of improvement projects and flood risk management on a household, neighborhood, and municipal level.","[Rodriguez-Gaviria, Edna M.; Builes-Jaramillo, Alejandro] Inst Univ Colegio Mayor Antioquia, Fac Engn & Architecture, Medellin 050034, Colombia; [Rodriguez-Gaviria, Edna M.; Botero-Fernandez, Veronica] Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Mines, Dept Geosci & Environm, Medellin 050034, Colombia; [Ochoa-Osorio, Sol] Inst Univ Colegio Mayor Antioquia, Disasters Risk Management Program, Fac Engn & Architecture, Medellin 050034, Colombia",Institucion Universitaria Colegio Mayor de Antioquia; Universidad Nacional de Colombia; Institucion Universitaria Colegio Mayor de Antioquia,"Rodriguez-Gaviria, EM (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Colegio Mayor Antioquia, Fac Engn & Architecture, Medellin 050034, Colombia.; Rodriguez-Gaviria, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Fac Mines, Dept Geosci & Environm, Medellin 050034, Colombia.",edna.rodriguez@colmayor.edu.co,"Botero-Fernandez, Veronica/R-5338-2017; Builes-Jaramillo, Alejandro/G-4841-2015","Botero-Fernandez, Veronica/0000-0002-6964-239X; RODRIGUEZ-GAVIRIA, EDNA MARGARITA/0000-0001-9461-6030; Builes-Jaramillo, Alejandro/0000-0002-3474-6922","Administrative Department of Science Technology and Innovation of Colombia (COLCIENCIAS)Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias [1118-660-44118]; Institucion Universitaria Colegio Mayor de Antioquia research projects grants 2017","This research was partially funded by the Administrative Department of Science Technology and Innovation of Colombia (COLCIENCIAS), grant number 1118-660-44118 and the Institucion Universitaria Colegio Mayor de Antioquia research projects grants 2017.",,76,3,3,4,9,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,4341,10.3390/su11164341,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,IV7UO,WOS:000484472500085,,gold,,,44661

In this work, we leverage the collective knowledge embedded in the social relationships of users on the network to predict user preferences and future behavior. We extract social dimensions in the form of overlapping communities that capture the behavioral heterogeneity in directed and signed social networks. We present an extension of signed modularity, namely Structural Balance Modularity (SBM). We first propose a metric Structural Balance Index (SBI) that determines users' degrees of affiliation towards various communities by harnessing the concept of the generalized theory of structural balance. We then incorporate SBI into the signed modularity to define SBM. It takes into account the density as well as the sign (positive or negative) of the links between users on the network. A genetic algorithm is developed that optimizes the SBM, thereby maximizing positive intra-community connections and negative inter-community connections. The discovered latent overlapping communities represent affiliations of users with similar preferences and mutual trust relationships captured by the signs of connections exerting differential effects on users' behaviors. Thereafter, we ascertain which communities are relevant for a targeted behavior by using discriminative learning. The computational experiments are performed on Epinions real-world dataset, and the results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficacy of our proposed approach.","[Awal, Gaganmeet Kaur; Bharadwaj, K.

However, designing successful social network interventions is a considerable research challenge. In this study, we rely on social network analysis and agent-based simulations to better understand and capitalize on the complex interplay of social networks and health behaviors. More specifically, we investigate criteria for selecting influence agents that can be expected to produce the most successful social network health interventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to test which selection criterion to determine influence agents in a social network intervention resulted in the biggest increase in physical activity in the social network. To test the differences among the selection criteria, a computational model was used to simulate different social network interventions and observe the intervention's effect on the physical activity of primary and secondary school children within their school classes. As a next step, this study relied on the outcomes of the simulated interventions to investigate whether social network interventions are more effective in some classes than others based on network characteristics. Methods: We used a previously validated agent-based model to understand how physical activity spreads in social networks and who was influencing the spread of behavior. From the observed data of 460 participants collected in 26 school classes, we simulated multiple social network interventions with different selection criteria for the influence agents (ie, in-degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and random influence agents) and a control condition (ie, no intervention). Subsequently, we investigated whether the detected variation of an intervention's success within school classes could be explained by structural characteristics of the social networks (ie, network density and network centralization). Results: The 1-year simulations showed that social network interventions were more effective compared with the control condition (beta=.30; t100=3.23; P=.001). In addition, the social network interventions that used a measure of centrality to select influence agents outperformed the random influence agent intervention (beta=.46; t100=3.86; P<.001). Also, the closeness centrality condition outperformed the betweenness centrality condition (beta=.59; t100=2.02; P=.046). The anticipated interaction effects of the network characteristics were not observed. Conclusions: Social network intervention can be considered as a viable and promising intervention method to promote physical activity. We demonstrated the usefulness of applying social network analysis and agent-based modeling as part of the social network interventions' design process. We emphasize the importance of selecting the most successful influence agents and provide a better understanding of the role of network characteristics on the effectiveness of social network interventions.","[van Woudenberg, Thabo J.; Bevelander, Kirsten E.; Burk, William J.; Smit, Crystal R.; Buijs, Laura; Buijzen, Moniek] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Simoski, Bojan; Araujo, Eric Fernandes de Mello; Klein, Michel] Vrije Univ, Social AI Grp, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bevelander, Kirsten E.] Radboud Univ & Med Ctr, Radboud Inst Hlth Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Woudenberg, TJ (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Behav Sci Inst, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,"Burk, William/AGK-4576-2022; van Woudenberg, Thabo/AAC-7180-2020; Klein, Michel/ABE-2297-2020; Bevelander, Kirsten E/E-7878-2012; Smit, Crystal/ABF-8929-2021; Buijzen, Moniek/Q-7428-2016","van Woudenberg, Thabo/0000-0002-8586-5876; Klein, Michel/0000-0003-4119-1846; Fernandes de Mello Araujo, Eric/0000-0003-4263-9075; , Kirsten/0000-0003-1011-7862; Buijzen, Moniek/0000-0003-3780-0856; Simoski, Bojan/0000-0002-6579-7634",European Research Council under the European UnionEuropean Research Council (ERC) [61725],The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC grant agreement number (61725).,,48,15,15,3,8,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

This study employs a sophisticated research design on a large collection of new data, utilizing natural language processing and approximate string matching to examine the relationship between the large-scale climate misinformation movement and US philanthropy. The study finds that over a twenty year period, networks of actors promulgating scientific misinformation about climate change were increasingly integrated into the institution of US philanthropy. The degree of integration is predicted by funding ties to prominent corporate donors. These findings reveal new knowledge about large-scale efforts to distort public understanding of science and sow polarization.

Understanding gender transition sentiment patterns can positively impact transgender people by enabling them to anticipate, and put support in place for, particularly difficult time periods. Yet, tracking sentiment over time throughout gender transition is challenging using traditional research methods. This study's objective was to use social media data to understand average gender transition sentiment patterns. Materials and Methods: Computational sentiment analysis and statistics were used to analyze 41 066 posts from 240 Tumblr transition blogs (online spaces where transgender people document gender transitions) to understand sentiment patterns over time and quantify relationships between transgender identity disclosures, sentiment, and social support. Results: Findings suggest that sentiment increases over time on average throughout gender transition, particularly when people receive supportive responses to transgender identity disclosures. However, after disclosures to family members, people experienced temporary increased negative sentiment, followed by increased positive sentiment in the long term. After transgender identity disclosures on Facebook, an important means of mass disclosure, those with supportive networks experienced increased positive sentiment. Conclusions: With foreknowledge of sentiment patterns likely to occur during gender transition, transgender people and their mental healthcare professionals can prepare with proper support in place throughout the gender transition process. Social media are a novel data source for understanding transgender people's sentiment patterns, which can help reduce mental health disparities for this marginalized population during a particularly difficult time.","[Haimson, Oliver L.] Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Haimson, OL (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Sch Informat, 105 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",haimson@umich.edu,,"Haimson, Oliver/0000-0001-6552-4540","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DGE-1321846]; University of California, IrvineUniversity of California System","This work was supported by National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships Program Grant No. DGE-1321846 and an internal grant from the University of California, Irvine (James Harvey Scholar Award).",,67,11,11,3,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1067-5027,1527-974X,,J AM MED INFORM ASSN,J.

First, most existing studies have focused on the US, and the cross-national validity of their results has rarely been tested. Second, previous studies that rely solely on behavioral data from social media tend to make strong analytical assumptions such as that Twitter users prefer to follow media and politicians whose ideological positions are similar to their own, and that the ideologies of political elites can be extrapolated to infer the ideologies of ordinary users. We aim to address these limitations. First, we focus on Japan to test the generalizability of US findings in an Asian context. Second, we do not rely solely on behavioral measurement but combine survey and social media data to infer the ideologies of Twitter users. Results indicate that our classifier built based on these self-reported ideologies produces more valid estimates than naive extrapolation from views of the elites. Based on these improved estimates of Twitter users' ideologies, we demonstrate that the ideological distributions of those who follow major Japanese media accounts on Twitter largely overlap, suggesting an absence of ideology-based audience fragmentation.","[Kobayashi, Tetsuro] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Media & Commun, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Ogawa, Yuki] Ritsumeikan Univ, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Kyoto, Japan; [Suzuki, Takahisa] Tsuda Univ, Coll Policy Studies, Tokyo, Japan; [Yamamoto, Hitoshi] Rissho Univ, Fac Business Adm, Tokyo, Japan",City University of Hong Kong; Ritsumeikan University,"Ogawa, Y (通讯作者)，Ritsumeikan Univ, 1-1-1 Nojihigashi, Kyoto 5258577, Japan.",y-ogawa@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,"KDDI Foundation, JAPANKDDI Corporation;  [16K16157];  [15KT0133]","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research: [Grant Number 16K16157 and 15KT0133] and the KDDI Foundation, JAPAN.",,56,3,3,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0129-2986,1742-0911,,ASIAN J COMMUN,Asian J.

What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the gut-human behavior axis and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and chrono-nutrition play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.","[Di Stefano, Alessandro; Scata, Marialisa; La Corte, Aurelio] CNIT Natl Interuniv Consortium Telecommun, DIEEI, Catania, Italy; [Vijayakumar, Supreeta; Angione, Claudio] Teesside Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Syst, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England; [Lio, Pietro] Univ Cambridge, Comp Lab, Cambridge, England",University of Teesside; University of Cambridge,"Di Stefano, A (通讯作者)，CNIT Natl Interuniv Consortium Telecommun, DIEEI, Catania, Italy.",alessandro.distefano@dieei.unict.it,"La Corte, Aurelio/H-4519-2017; SCATÀ, Marialisa/AAM-4892-2020; P.

It has been proposed that such might be the case in situations involving stereotype threat. Here, we provide the first empirical test of this hypothesis. Using a visual search task, we asked participants, on a trial-by-trial basis, to monitor the unfolding and accuracy of their search processes, and we developed a computational model to measure the accuracy of their metacognition. Results indicated that stereotype threat enhanced metacognitive monitoring of both outcomes and processes. Our study thus shows that social context can actually affect metacognition.","[Gajdos, Thibault; Regner, Isabelle] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LPC, Marseille, France; [Huguet, Pascal] Univ Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, LAPSCO, Clermont Ferrand, France; [Hainguerlot, Marine; Vergnaud, Jean-Christophe] CNRS, UMR 8174, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France; [Sackur, Jerome] PSL Res Univ, CNRS, EHESS, Lab Sci Cognit & Psycholinguist ENS, Paris, France; [Sackur, Jerome] Ecole Polytech, Palaiseau, France; [de Gardelle, Vincent] CNRS, Paris, France; [de Gardelle, Vincent] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); PSL Research University Paris; Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS); Universite de Paris; Institut Polytechnique de Paris; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Paris; Paris School of Economics,"Gajdos, T (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, LPC, Marseille, France.",thibault.gajdos@univ-amu.fr,"Régner, Isabelle/AAE-4826-2020; de Gardelle, Vincent/I-1226-2014","de Gardelle, Vincent/0000-0001-5977-5597; Huguet, Pascal/0000-0002-0707-7655; gajdos, thibault/0000-0001-6906-4836","CNRS (Mission pour l'interdisciplinarite grant); Agence Nationale pour la RechercheFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-16-CE28-0002, ANR-16-ASTR-0014]","This work was supported by funding from the CNRS (Mission pour l'interdisciplinarite grant to TG), from the Agence Nationale pour la Recherche (ANR-16-CE28-0002 to VdG and ANR-16-ASTR-0014 to JS and VdG).

They attract attention, trigger emotions, and shape consumers' first impressions of products and brands. We propose that the shift from one-to-many mass communication to highly personalized one-to-one communication requires an understanding of image appeal at a personal level. Instead of asking How appealing is this image? we ask How appealing is this image to this particular consumer? Using the well-established five-factor model of personality, we apply machine learning algorithms to predict an image's personality appeal-the personality of consumers to which the image appeals most-from a set of 89 automatically extracted image features (Study 1). We subsequently apply the same algorithm on new images to predict consequential outcomes from the fit between consumer and image personality. We show that image-person fit adds incremental predictive power over the images' general appeal when predicting (a) consumers' liking of new images (Study 2) and (b) consumers' attitudes and purchase intentions (Study 3).","[Matz, Sandra C.] Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Segalin, Cristina] CALTECH, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; [Stillwell, David; Muller, Sandrine R.] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England; [Bos, Maarten W.] Snap Inc, Santa Monica, CA USA",Columbia University; California Institute of Technology; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Cambridge,"Matz, SC (通讯作者)，Columbia Business Sch, New York, NY 10027 USA.",sm4409@gsb.columbia.edu,"Müller, Sandrine Ruth/ABA-1888-2020","Müller, Sandrine Ruth/0000-0002-1226-6370; Matz, Sandra C./0000-0002-0969-4403",,,,88,14,15,10,70,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",1057-7408,1532-7663,,J CONSUM PSYCHOL,J.

Specifically, we examine whether the anti-Park group and its countering pro-Park group manifested different semantic structures in their comments on Facebook pages. To do so, we collected 144,639 and 29,133 comments on the anti-Park and pro-Park pages, respectively, over 5 months (October 2016-March 2017) and constructed semantic networks from the comments made during the heady days of activism. Our analysis of word co-occurrence and community structure for each network demonstrates that the anti-Park activism engaged in random and polysemic patterns of word use. In contrast, the organization-based pro-Park activism exhibited scale-free and semantically coherent organizing. This finding explicates the linguistic mechanism by which the connective logic of engagement affords affective expressions that generate loosely formatted but collaboratively coordinated identities to intensify feelings of engagement.","[Lee, Shin Haeng] Sejong Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lim, Tae Yun] Hongik Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Sejong University; Hongik University,"Lee, SH (通讯作者)，Sejong Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",shinlee@sejong.ac.kr; tylim27@hongik.ac.kr,"Lim, Tae Yun/AAW-5140-2020; LEE, SHIN HAENG/AAE-2507-2019","LEE, SHIN HAENG/0000-0003-2817-3969",Sejong University [20180412],This work was supported by a grant from Sejong University in 2018 (Grant #20180412).,,40,3,3,4,10,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

Here we show that this apparent conflict is regulated by the social learning strategies deployed. We examined the patterns of human social learning through an interactive online experiment with 699 participants, varying both task uncertainty and group size, then used hierarchical Bayesian model fitting to identify the individual learning strategies exhibited by participants. Challenging tasks elicit greater conformity among individuals, with rates of copying increasing with group size, leading to high probabilities of herding among large groups confronted with uncertainty. Conversely, the reduced social learning of small groups, and the greater probability that social information would be accurate for less-challenging tasks, generated 'wisdom of the crowd' effects in other circumstances. Our model-based approach provides evidence that the likelihood of collective intelligence versus herding can be predicted, resolving a long-standing puzzle in the literature.","[Toyokawa, Wataru; Whalen, Andrew; Laland, Kevin N.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Toyokawa, Wataru] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Toyokawa, Wataru] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Adv Sci, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Japan",University of St Andrews; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Graduate University for Advanced Studies - Japan,"Toyokawa, W (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.; Toyokawa, W (通讯作者)，Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan.; Toyokawa, W (通讯作者)，Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Adv Sci, Dept Evolutionary Studies Biosyst, Hayama, Japan.",wt25@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Laland, Kevin/0000-0002-2457-0900; Toyokawa, Wataru/0000-0001-8558-8568","John Templeton Foundation [40128]; Suntory FoundationSuntory Foundation for Life Sciences [2015-311]; JSPS overseas research fellowships [H27-11]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17J01559]","This experiment was supported by The John Templeton Foundation (40128 to K.N.L.) and Suntory Foundation research support (2015-311 to W.T.).

For this reason, regulators have been aiming to empower consumers to exercise more control over their data. Companies that collect and process data for personalized advertising are required to be transparent and among others, provide consumers with technical knowledge about the personalization process. At the same time, they have started offering settings to withdraw consent for processing data for personalization purposes by opting out from personalized advertising. However, such opt-out functions remain mostly unused. Thus, this study investigates first, if technical knowledge about personalization empowers consumers to use such opt-out functions and second, what mechanisms can explain the empowering impact of knowledge. Drawing on Rogers' (1975) protection motivation theory (PMT) and applying an innovative combination of traditional (online experiment, N = 425, M-age = 48) and computational (online behavior tracking, N = 80, M-age = 48) research methods, the study shows that technical knowledge has no empowering effect on consumers by indirectly lowering opt-out motivation and behavior. The results also demonstrate that perceived severity and response efficacy increase motivation to opt-out, while positive attitude towards personalization and perceived self-efficacy lower it. Being one of the first studies to apply PMT to personalization context and computational methods to measure opt-out, it offers several important societal and theoretical implications regarding consumer empowerment and personalized advertising online.","[Strycharz, Joanna; van Noort, Guda; Smit, Edith] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Helberger, Natali] Univ Amsterdam, Inst Informat Law IViR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Amsterdam,"Strycharz, J (通讯作者)，Amsterdam Sch Commun Res, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.strycharz@uva.nl,"Strycharz, Joanna/U-2387-2017; Jia, Chuanchang/AAA-5513-2020","Strycharz, Joanna/0000-0001-7739-3349; Helberger, Natali/0000-0003-1652-0580; van Noort, Guda/0000-0002-6314-1455",University of Amsterdam Research Priority Area 'Personalised Communication'; Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Commerciele Communicatie (SWOCC),"This research was funded by and made possible through the University of Amsterdam Research Priority Area 'Personalised Communication' (personalised-communication.net), as well as through the support of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Commerciele Communicatie (SWOCC).

Materials and methods: A comprehensive literature search of 1964 articles from PubMed and EMBASE was narrowed to 21 eligible articles. Data related to purpose, text source, number of users and/or posts, evaluation metrics, and quality indicators were recorded. Results: Pain (n= 18) and fatigue and sleep disturbance (n= 18) were the most frequently evaluated symptom clinical content categories. Studies accessed ePAT from sources such as Twitter and online community forums or patient portals focused on diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and depression. Fifteen studies used NLP as a primary methodology. Studies reported evaluation metrics including the precision, recall, and F-measure for symptom-specific research questions. Discussion: NLP and text mining have been used to extract and analyze patient-authored symptom data in a wide variety of online communities. Though there are computational challenges with accessing ePAT, the depth of information provided directly from patients offers new horizons for precision medicine, characterization of sub-clinical symptoms, and the creation of personal health libraries as outlined by the National Library of Medicine. Conclusion: Future research should consider the needs of patients expressed through ePAT and its relevance to symptom science. Understanding the role that ePAT plays in health communication and real-time assessment of symptoms, through the use of NLP and text mining, is critical to a patient-centered health system.","[Dreisbach, Caitlin] Univ Virginia, Sch Nursing, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA; [Dreisbach, Caitlin; Bourne, Philip E.] Univ Virginia, Data Sci Inst, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Koleck, Theresa A.; Bakken, Suzanne] Columbia Univ, Sch Nursing, New York, NY USA; [Bourne, Philip E.] Univ Virginia, Dept Biomed Engn, Charlottesville, VA USA; [Bakken, Suzanne] Columbia Univ, Dept Biomed Informat, New York, NY USA; [Bakken, Suzanne] Columbia Univ, Data Sci Inst, New York, NY USA",University of Virginia; University of Virginia; Columbia University; University of Virginia; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Bakken, S (通讯作者)，560 West 168th St,Mail Code 6, New York, NY 10032 USA.",sbh22@cumc.columbia.edu,"Dreisbach, Caitlin/ABH-9611-2020; Bourne, Philip/ABG-8967-2021; Dreisbach, Caitlin/AAG-1093-2019","Bourne, Philip/0000-0002-7618-7292; ","Reducing Health Disparities Through Informatics training grant [T32NR007969]; Precision in Symptom Self-Management (PriSSM) Center [P30NR016587]; Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through the Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques [K99NR017651]; National Research Service AwardUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [F31NR017821]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NURSING RESEARCHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) [F31NR017821, T32NR007969, P30NR016587] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work is supported by the Reducing Health Disparities Through Informatics training grant (T32NR007969), the Precision in Symptom Self-Management (PriSSM) Center (P30NR016587) and Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through the Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques (K99NR017651).

A revived conceptualization of the Russian media as a uniform system driven by a well-coordinated propagandistic state effort, though having evidence thereunder, does not allow seeing the public discussion inside Russia as a more diverse and multifaceted process. This is especially true for the Russian-language mediated discussions online, which, in the recent years, have proven to be efficient enough in raising both social issues and waves of political protest, including on-street spillovers. While, in the recent years, several attempts have been made to demonstrate the complexity of the Russian media system at large, the content and structures of the Russian-language online discussions remain seriously understudied. The thematic issue draws attention to various aspects of online public discussions in Runet; it creates a perspective in studying Russian mediated communication at the level of Internet users. The articles are selected in the way that they not only contribute to the systemic knowledge on the Russian media but also add to the respective subdomains of media research, including the studies on social problem construction, news values, political polarization, and affect in communication.","[Koltsova, Olessia] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Internet Studies, St Petersburg 192148, Russia; [Bodrunova, Svetlana S.] St Petersburg State Univ, Sch Journalism & Mass Communicat, St Petersburg 199004, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Saint Petersburg State University,"Koltsova, O (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ, Lab Internet Studies, St Petersburg 192148, Russia.",ekoltsova@hse.ru; s.bodrunova@spbu.ru,"Bodrunova, Svetlana S/H-7051-2013","Bodrunova, Svetlana S/0000-0003-0740-561X",,,,25,0,0,2,5,COGITATIO PRESS,LISBON,"RUA FIALHO ALMEIDA 14, 2 ESQ, LISBON, 1070-129, PORTUGAL",2183-2439,,,MEDIA COMMUN-LISBON,Media Commun.,,2019,7,3,,,,,114,118,,10.17645/mac.v7i3.2389,,,5,Communication,,Communication,JO8FV,WOS:000497811200001,,"Green Published, gold",,,44661

This characteristic makes forums valuable for identifying users in need of immediate help from mental health professionals. Because it would be impractical to manually review every post on a forum to identify users in need of urgent help, there may be value to developing algorithms for automatically detecting posts reflecting a heightened risk of imminent plans to engage in disordered behaviors. Method Five natural language processing techniques (tools to perform computational text analysis) were used on a data set of 4,812 posts obtained from six eating disorder-related subreddits. Two licensed clinical psychologists labeled 53 of these posts, deciding whether or not the content of the post indicated that its author needed immediate professional help. The remaining 4,759 posts were unlabeled. Results Each of the five techniques ranked the 50 posts most likely to be intervention-worthy (the top-50). The two most accurate detection techniques had an error rate of 4% for their respective top-50. Discussion This article demonstrates the feasibility of automatically detecting-with only a few dozen labeled examples-the posts of individuals in need of immediate mental health support for an eating disorder.","[Yan, Hao; Das, Sanmay] Washington Univ St Louis, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, St Louis, MO USA; [Fitzsimmons-Craft, Ellen E.; Goodman, Micah; Krauss, Melissa; Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia] Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 660 South Euclid Ave,Box 8134, St Louis, MO 63110 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Washington University (WUSTL),"Cavazos-Rehg, P (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, 660 South Euclid Ave,Box 8134, St Louis, MO 63110 USA.",pcavazos@wustl.edu,,"Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia/0000-0003-3352-1198","National Institute of Mental HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21 MH112331, R34 MH119170]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) [R21MH112331, R34MH119170] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DRUG ABUSEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)European Commission [K02DA043657] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","National Institute of Mental Health, Grant/Award Numbers: R21 MH112331, R34 MH119170",,29,14,15,3,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0276-3478,1098-108X,,INT J EAT DISORDER,Int.

Methodologically, such studies either ask journalists whether they perceive their own professional role in accordance with common conceptualizations (e.g., being a watchdog), or they search for journalistic roles in the news through content analyses, or apply combined approaches. However, methodologically, this decomposition of news has been primarily confirmatory in nature with the goal to find journalistic roles in the news. We therefore develop and empirically explore an alternative bottom-up approach to news content. Applying latent class analysis to an existing dataset from 16 Western democracies that includes 23 different, role-independent content indicators for political news shows that news composition types correspond well with six journalistic roles (informational-instructive; analytical-deliberative; critical-monitorial; advocative-radical; developmental-educative; collaborative-facilitative). If combined with existing confirmatory approaches, this methodological alternative could triangulate pitfalls of this line of research.","[Scherr, Sebastian] Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Leuven, Belgium; [Bachl, Marko] Univ Hohenheim, Dept Commun, Stuttgart, Germany; [de Vreese, Claes H.] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Sch Commun Res ASCoR, Amsterdam, Netherlands",KU Leuven; University Hohenheim; University of Amsterdam,"Scherr, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Leuven, Belgium.",sebastian.scherr@kuleuven.be,"Scherr, Sebastian/ABE-5525-2020","Scherr, Sebastian/0000-0003-4730-1575",,,,46,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-670X,1469-9699,,JOURNALISM STUD,Journal.

However, even in the Russian domestic context, where anecdotal evidence of state activity online goes back almost a decade, no public systematic attempt has been made to dissect the population of Russian social media bots by their political orientation. We address this gap by developing a deep neural network classifier that separates pro-regime, anti-regime, and neutral Russian Twitter bots. Our method relies on supervised machine learning and a new large set of labeled accounts, rather than externally obtained account affiliations or orientation of elites. We also illustrate the use of our method by applying it to bots operating in Russian political Twitter from 2015 to 2017 and show that both pro- and anti-Kremlin bots had a substantial presence on Twitter.","[Stukal, Denis; Sanovich, Sergey; Tucker, Joshua A.; Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Social Media & Polit Participat SMaPP Lab, New York, NY USA; [Tucker, Joshua A.] NYU, Dept Polit, 2nd Floor,19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA; [Tucker, Joshua A.; Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Ctr Data Sci, New York, NY USA; [Bonneau, Richard] NYU, Dept Biol, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University; New York University; New York University; New York University,"Stukal, D (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Polit, 2nd Floor,19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",denis.stukal@gmail.com,"Bonneau, Richard/ABD-6737-2021; Stukal, Denis/ABA-3314-2020","Stukal, Denis/0000-0001-6240-5714; Sanovich, Sergey/0000-0003-4897-5264","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [SES-1248077, SES 1756657]; William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; Rita Allen Foundation; Knight Foundation; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Craig Newmark Philanthropies; Democracy Fund; Intel CorporationIntel Corporation; New York University Global Institute for Advanced Study; New York University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support for the NYU Social Media and Political Participation (SMaPP) lab from the National Science Foundation (Awards SES-1248077; SES 1756657), the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Rita Allen Foundation, the Knight Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, the Democracy Fund, the Intel Corporation, the New York University Global Institute for Advanced Study, and Dean Thomas Carew's Research Investment Fund at New York University.",,49,12,12,11,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2158-2440,,,SAGE OPEN,SAGE Open,44663,2019,9,2,,,,,,,,10.1177/2158244019827715,,,16,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",,Social Sciences - Other Topics,HT3LX,WOS:000464466400001,,gold,,,44661

We hypothesize that conservative individuals will be more likely than liberals to be potentially exposed to pro-Russian disinformation in digital networks. We evaluate the hypothesis using a large data set of U.S.-based Twitter users, testing how ideology is associated with disinformation about the 2014 crash of the MH17 aircraft over eastern Ukraine. We find that potential exposure to disinformation is concentrated among the most conservative individuals. Moving from the most liberal to the most conservative individuals in the sample is associated with a change in the conditional probability of potential exposure to disinformation from 6.5% to 45.2%. We corroborate the finding using a second, validated data set on individual party registration. The results indicate that the reach of online, pro-Russian disinformation into U.S. audiences is distinctly ideologically asymmetric.","[Hjorth, Frederik; Adler-Nissen, Rebecca] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Copenhagen,"Hjorth, F (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Polit Sci, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",fh@ifs.ku.dk,,,Carlsberg FoundationCarlsberg Foundation [CF16-0012],"This study was conducted as part of the Digital Disinformation project (project no.

This study examines how human learners put two imperfect heads together to make utility-maximizing decisions. Participants played a card game where they chose to stay with a card of known value or switch to an unknown card, given an advisor's advice to stay or switch. Participants used advice strategically based on which cards the advisor could see (Experiment 1), how helpful the advisor was (Experiment 2), and what strategy the advisor used to select advice (Experiment 3). Overall, participants benefited even from imperfect advice based on incomplete information. Participants' responses were consistent with a Bayesian model that jointly infers how the advisor selects advice and the value of the advisor's card, compared to an alternative model that weights advice based on the advisor's accuracy. By reasoning about others' minds, human learners can make the best of even noisy, impoverished social information.","[Velez, Natalia; Gweon, Hyowon] Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Serra Mall,Jordan Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Velez, N; Gweon, H (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Psychol, 450 Serra Mall,Jordan Hall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nvelez@stanford.edu; gweon@stanford.edu,,,,,,26,7,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1756-8757,1756-8765,,TOP COGN SCI,Top.

In this paper, we discuss what online field experiments are and how they differ from traditional experiments as well as online lab and survey experiments. We show how researchers can go about designing and implementing online field experiments, focusing on issues where online field experiments differ from their traditional counterparts - legal and ethical considerations, construct validity, randomization and spillover, and statistical analyses.

Potential for equifinality exists in all empirical studies of cultural transmission including controlled experiments, observational field research, and computational simulations. Acknowledging and anticipating the existence of equifinality is important in empirical studies of social learning and cultural evolution; it helps us understand the limitations of analytical approaches and can improve our ability to predict the dynamics of cultural transmission. Here, I illustrate and discuss examples of equifinality in studies of social learning, and how certain experimental designs might be prone to it. I then review examples of equifinality discussed in the social learning literature, namely the use of s-shaped diffusion curves to discern individual from social learning and operational definitions and analytical approaches used in studies of conformist transmission. While equifinality exists to some extent in all studies of social learning, I make suggestions for how to address instances of it, with an emphasis on using data simulation and methodological verification alongside modern statistical approaches that emphasize prediction and model comparison. In cases where evaluated learning mechanisms are equifinal due to non-methodological factors, I suggest that this is not always a problem if it helps us predict cultural change. In some cases, equifinal learning mechanisms might offer insight into how both individual learning, social learning strategies and other endogenous social factors might by important in structuring cultural dynamics and within- and between-group heterogeneity.","[Barrett, Brendan J.] Univ Calif Davis, Anim Behav Grad Grp, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Barrett, Brendan J.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Anthropol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Barrett, BJ (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Evolutionary Anthropol, Dept Human Behav Ecol & Culture, Deutsch Pl 6, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany.",bbarrett@orn.mpg.de,"Barrett, Brendan J/J-1459-2019","Barrett, Brendan J/0000-0002-2725-2385",NSF Graduate Research FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1650042],"Thank you to Karthik Panchanathan and Billy Baum for inviting me to contribute to this special issue.

In recent years, tag-based interactions and conformity bias have been studied extensively but separately as two viable mechanisms for cooperation enhancement in such systems. Inspired by recent studies on interaction effects in social dilemmas, we herein develop a hybrid, multiagent-based, co-evolutionary model of tag-mediated cooperation and conformity with conditional and unconditional strategies. Through a series of extensive Monte Carlo simulation experiments, we study four variants of this computational model, finding that under the majority rule, the nonconforming unconditional cooperators and conformity biased transmission of other strategies can lead to global altruistic dominance. Employing a random pinning control mechanism, we further observe that only a small fraction of nonconforming altruists is actually required to drive the system towards a robust persistence of pure altruism. Our analytic results in combination with further computational experiments reveal that spatial structure and nonconformity of cooperators are the two indispensable ingredients for the stable dominance of altruistic behavior in tag-based multiagent systems. Our findings can be beneficial for developing novel cooperation-controlling techniques in distributed self-organizing systems such as peer-to-peer networks or in various social networking and viral marketing technologies.

Reliability was established when two different metrics of inter-coder reliability could not distinguish whether a human or a machine coded the text on a separate hold-out set. Finally, in Step 3 we assessed validity. To accomplish this, we administered a survey in which participants described their own relational uncertainty/certainty via text and completed a questionnaire. After classifying the text, the machine's classifications of the participants' text positively correlated with the subjects' own self-reported relational uncertainty and relational satisfaction. We discuss our results in line with areas of computational communication science, content analysis, and interpersonal communication.","[Pilny, Andrew; McAninch, Kelly; Slone, Amanda; Moore, Kelsey] Univ Kentucky, Dept Commun, Lexington, KY USA",University of Kentucky,"Pilny, A (通讯作者)，269 Blazer Dining, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",andy.pilny@uky.edu,,,University of Kentucky,This work was supported by the University of Kentucky [Research and Creative Activities Program].,,65,6,6,3,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1931-2458,1931-2466,,COMMUN METHODS MEAS,Commun.

In this work, we performed a quasi-experimental analysis of hundreds of millions of chat room messages between young people. This allowed us to reconstruct how-and on what timeline-the valence of one message affects the valence of subsequent messages by others. For the highly emotionally valenced chat messages that we focused on, we found that these messages elicited a general increase of 0.1 to 0.4 messages per minute. This influence started 2 s after the original message and continued out to 60 s. Expanding our focus to include feedback loops-the way a speaker's chat comes back to affect him or her-we found that the stimulating effects of these same chat events started rippling back from others 8 s after the original message, to cause an increase in the speaker's chat that persisted for up to 8 min. This feedback accounted for at least 1% of the bulk of chat. Additionally, a message's valence affects its dynamics, with negative events feeding back more slowly and continuing to affect the speaker longer. By reconstructing the second-by-second dynamics of many psychosocial processes in aggregate, we captured the timescales at which they collectively ripple through a social system to drive system-level outcomes.","[Frey, Seth] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Frey, Seth] Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Frey, Seth; Sumner, Robert W.; Bos, Maarten W.] Disney Res, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA; [Donnay, Karsten] Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany; [Donnay, Karsten; Helbing, Dirk; Sumner, Robert W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Zurich, Switzerland; [Bos, Maarten W.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; Dartmouth College; University of Konstanz; ETH Zurich; Carnegie Mellon University,"Frey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Commun, Davis, CA 95616 USA.; Frey, S (通讯作者)，Dartmouth Coll, Neukom Inst, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.; Frey, S (通讯作者)，Disney Res, Los Angeles, CA 90032 USA.",sfrey@ucdavis.edu,"Frey, Seth/AAF-8499-2021; Donnay, Karsten/S-2990-2016","Frey, Seth/0000-0002-5298-5089; Donnay, Karsten/0000-0002-9080-6539",Minerva Grant [FA9550-14-1-0353 DEF]; ERC Advanced Investigator Momentum [324247]; Neukom Institute for Computational Science,"S.F. wishes to thank Michael Mas, Emma Templeton, Beau Sievers, David Garcia, and Luke Chang for their ideas, guidance, and input.

A community is generally assumed to be formed by people who possess similar attributes or characteristics, also known as homophily. Although there has been a lot of research on community detection based on network topology, the semantic interpretation of communities is rarely studied. The present work aims to understand the behavioral similarity of users present in their personal neighborhood communities formed by friends, relatives, or colleagues, and addresses two fundamental questions: (i) Are communities firmed by users who possess similar behavioral traits? If so, does this apply to all those sub-networks, i.e., friends, relatives, and colleagues? (ii) Does adding behavioral node-specific attributes/features to the nodes in a network lead to better community detection? To better understand the psycho-sociological homophilic nature of personal networks, the personalities and values of Twitter users were analyzed using the well-established Big-5 personality model and Schwartz sociological behavior model. Empirical results based on the psychosociological behavior show that friends networks exhibit homophily, whereas relatives and colleagues networks do not exhibit such homophilic behavior. It can also be observed that neurotic people tend to behave heterogeneously with people of various personality traits. In addition, it is shown that such empirical evidence can be used as features for the tasks of community detection and link prediction.","[Solomon, R. Sudhesh; Srinivas, P. Y. K.

The notion of complex networks offers a conceptual lens to analyze the emergence and evolution of a digital innovation ecosystem. The framework uses digital data and evolutionary community detection analysis for the empirical inquiry of the digital innovation landscape. The proposed framework is applied to the big data ecosystem. Data from Twitter, for a three year period, is processed and analyzed. This study reveals a large number of elements that are diverse in form and capacity, including organizations, concepts (e.g., #analytics, #iot), technologies (e.g., #hadoop), applications (e.g., #healthcare), infrastructures (e.g., #cloud), regulations, professional meetings and associations, tools, and knowledge. These elements and their communities have evolved in the big data ecosystem. The findings highlight the evolution of digital innovation by two mechanisms, variation and selective retention, which are nonlinear and often unpredictable. Implications are presented and potential ways to improve the proposed framework are discussed.

We examine the coverage of more than 20,000 successful women and men from various social and occupational domains in more than 2,000 news sources as welt as web searches for these individuals as a behavioral measure of interest.

An additional complexity is that there can be different types of false information that travel from and through different communities who respond in various ways within the same social media conversation. Here we present a case study/example analysis exploring the speed and reach of three different types of false stories found in the Black Panther movie Twitter conversation and comparing the diffusion of these stories with the community responses to them. We find that the negative reaction to fake stories of racially-motivated violence whether in the form of debunking quotes or satirical posts can spread at speeds that are magnitudes higher than the original fake stories. Satire posts, while less viral than debunking quotes, appear to have longer lifetimes in the conversation. We also found that the majority of mixed community members who originally spread fake stories switched to attacking them. Our work serves as an example of the importance of analyzing the diffusion of both different types of disinformation and the different responses to it within the same overall conversation.","[Babcock, Matthew; Cox, Ramon Alfonso Villa; Kumar, Sumeet] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Carnegie Mellon University,"Babcock, M (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",mbabcock@cs.cmu.edu,"Kumar, Sumeet/AAX-7387-2020","Kumar, Sumeet/0000-0003-2715-7107; Villa-Cox, Ramon/0000-0002-6462-9153",,,,17,8,8,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-298X,1572-9346,,COMPUT MATH ORGAN TH,Comput.

We collected tweets and replies on few specific topics and created a dataset with text, user, emotion, sentiment information, etc. We used the dataset to detect sentiment and emotion from tweets and their replies and measured the influence scores of users based on various user-based and tweet-based parameters. Finally, we used the latter information to generate generalized and personalized recommendations for users based on their twitter activity. The method we used in this paper includes some interesting novelties such as, (i) including replies to tweets in the dataset and measurements, (ii) introducing agreement score, sentiment score and emotion score of replies in influence score calculation.

Lack of entrainment could, therefore, negatively impact conversational success. Although studied in many disciplines, entrainment has received limited attention in the field of speech-language pathology, where its implications may have direct clinical relevance. Method: A novel computational methodology, informed by expert clinical assessment of conversation, was developed to investigate conversational entrainment across multiple speech dimensions in a corpus of experimentally elicited conversations involving healthy participants. The predictive relationship between the methodology output and an objective measure of conversational success, communicative efficiency, was then examined. Results: Using a real versus sham validation procedure, we find evidence of sustained entrainment in rhythmic, articulatory, and phonatory dimensions of speech. We further validate the methodology, showing that models built on speech signal entrainment measures consistently outperform models built on nonentrained speech signal measures in predicting communicative efficiency of the conversations. Conclusions: A multidimensional, clinically meaningful methodology for capturing conversational entrainment, validated in healthy populations, has implications for disciplines such as speech-language pathology where conversational entrainment represents a critical knowledge gap in the field, as well as a potential target for remediation.","[Borrie, Stephanie A.] Utah State Univ, Dept Commun Disorders & Deaf Educ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Barrett, Tyson S.] Utah State Univ, Dept Kinesiol & Hlth Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Willi, Megan M.] Calif State Univ Chico, Dept Commun Sci & Disorders, Chico, CA 95929 USA; [Berisha, Visar] Arizona State Univ, Dept Speech & Hearing Sci, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Berisha, Visar] Arizona State Univ, Sch Elect Comp & Energy Engn, Tempe, AZ USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; California State University System; California State University Chico; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Borrie, SA (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Commun Disorders & Deaf Educ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",stephanie.borrie@usu.edu,,"Borrie, Stephanie/0000-0002-2336-0071; Berisha, Visar/0000-0001-8804-8874",National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication DisordersUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R21DC016084]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON DEAFNESS AND OTHER COMMUNICATION DISORDERSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Deafness & Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) [R21DC016084] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,This research was supported by the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Grant R21DC016084 awarded to Stephanie Borrie and Visar Berisha.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features.

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user's mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved-but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user's relationship to it should be.

They seem to establish ways to suspend death by digital means as they perpetuate some communicative aspects of the deceased individual. This article shows how a new logic of negotiation between life and death is not restricted to such specialized services like LivesOn, Eterni.me and DeadSocial. On the contrary, the computational processes that are embedded in massively used communication platforms enforce a phenomenon that I suggest to coin with the term algorithmic undeath: Web algorithms for recommendation and personalization in general establish a post mortem prolongation of individual communication. The article unfolds this argument, suggests a categorization of dimensions of death and closes with some remarks about the cultural and social significance of algorithmic undeath. The algorithmic perpetuation of some aspects of individual communications poses serious questions in relation to our concept of death, work, expropriation and value creation, personal identity, authorship and continuity, but also in relation to the question of creativity and the social value of oblivion.","[Lehner, Nikolaus] Univ Wien, Inst Sociol, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Lehner, N (通讯作者)，Univ Wien, Inst Sociol, Vienna, Austria.",nikolaus.lehner@outlook.com,"Lehner, Nikolaus/AAB-7237-2019",,,,,70,0,0,3,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-4312,1469-3666,,CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU,Continuum-J.

Unfortunately, the explosive rate of information entering Twitter makes the users experience information overload. Since a great deal of tweets revolve around news events, summarising the storyline of these events can be advantageous to users, allowing them to conveniently access relevant and key information scattered over numerous tweets and, consequently, draw concise conclusions. A storyline shows the evolution of a story through time and sketches the correlations among its significant events. In this article, we propose a novel framework for generating a storyline of news events from a social point of view. Utilising powerful concepts from graph theory, we identify the significant events, summarise them and generate a coherent storyline of their evolution with reasonable computational cost for large datasets. Our approach models a storyline as a directed tree of socially salient events evolving over time in which nodes represent main events and edges capture the semantic relations between related events. We evaluate our proposed method against human-generated storylines, as well as the previous state-of-the-art storyline generation algorithm, on two large-scale datasets, one consisting of English tweets and the other one consisting of Persian tweets. We find that the results of our method are superior to the previous best algorithm and can be comparable with human-generated storylines.","[Dehghani, Nazanin; Asadpour, Masoud] Univ Tehran, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Social Networks Lab, Tehran 14395515, Iran",University of Tehran,"Dehghani, N (通讯作者)，Univ Tehran, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Social Networks Lab, Tehran 14395515, Iran.",ndehghany@ut.ac.ir,,,,,,67,0,1,3,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0165-5515,1741-6485,,J INF SCI,J.

The study addressed two research questions: (1) Can crowd-sourced text data be utilized in representing place identity? (2) Can collective place identity be expressed in the form of a cognitive map? By confirming that text data gathered from social media effectively demonstrate people's behaviors and perceptions related to places, we propose a novel method to create a visual representation of urban identity-a crowd-sourced cognitive map. In particular, to improve the conventional cognitive mapping method to depict the collective identity of a city, we draw cognitive maps of Bundang and Ilsan developed in the 1990s, as well as Songdo and Dongtan developed in the 2000s, just outside of the administrative boundaries of Seoul in Korea, through a computational method based on crowd-sourced opinions collected from social media. We open the possibility for the use of social media text data to capture the identity of cities and suggest a graphical image through which people without prior information could also easily apprehend the overall image of a city. The work in this paper is expected to provide a methodological technique for appropriate decision-making and the evaluation of urban identity to shape a more unique and imageable city.","[Jang, Kee Moon; Kim, Youngchul] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, KAIST Urban Design Lab, Daejeon, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST),"Kim, Y (通讯作者)，Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, KAIST Urban Design Lab, Daejeon, South Korea.",youngchulkim@kaist.ac.kr,"KIM, Youngchul/C-3814-2013","KIM, Youngchul/0000-0001-7945-028X","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science and ICT [NRF-2017M3C1A6075020]; Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) - Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea [19CTAP-C142170-02]","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Ministry of Science and ICT for convergent research in EDucation-research Integration through Simulation On the Net (EDISON) (NRF-2017M3C1A6075020) and by the Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement (KAIA) grant funded by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport of Korea (19CTAP-C142170-02).

We consider how the repetition of information can signal policy coalescence across interested groups and individuals, as well as proxy quality and exert a psychological effect. We employ nuanced computational text analytic tools that are new to this line of inquiry to assess the extent to which information in a brief is shared among all briefs and lower court opinions in the case. Using these measures, we investigate the relationship between novel and shared information and the content of Supreme Court opinions. We do so over the entire substantive content of a new dataset of more than 12,000 litigant and amicus briefs filed in U.S. Supreme Court cases from 1988 to 2005.

A total of 7396 postings by 764 authors were retrieved using a computational approach (a total of 1572 members participated in these posts). For the purposes of this study, the Likes received by each posting were considered an indication of the level of approval of others' viewpoints or appreciation for the information shared by other participants. The 311 posts (4%) that received more than 41 Likes represented 19,451 Likes (21.6%) expressed by the group members. We selected and examined them in depth using qualitative content analysis and discourse analysis. Finally, the 122 authors of the 311 entries were clustered into three profiles and analyzed to determine the patterns of magnet participants or opinion leaders. Overall, this study provided a vehicle to determine the ways by which the characteristics of new literacy practices, especially collective intelligence, appropriation, and fun, are applied in the context of a FB group, which functions as an informal learning environment in a formal learning setting. The study also identified the content, format, peer interactions, and student-teacher interactions of a student-managed and residential teacher-facilitated, technology-enhanced learning environment in support of the mission of the residential program. The study's findings demonstrate how an online platform played a significant role in supporting the learning experience occurring in a dormitory and the face-to-face activities of the participants. Such a platform has the advantages of involving more people and supplementing the college students' process of striving for social and intellectual development by allowing them to state opinions, negotiate meanings, address confrontation, articulate reasoning, and consider options. The platform also facilitates the equally important process of emotional development, as it provides the students with a sense of belonging, allows them to enjoy shared moments, and enhances their perceptions of being able to contribute to a common goal.","[Chen, Su-Yen; Kuo, Hsin-Yu; Hsieh, T.

Twitter account-creation dates within hashtag samples are used as a primary indicator for detecting Twitter bots. Following identification, the various modalities of their deployment in the crisis are analyzed. It is argued that bots were used during the crisis primarily to increase negative information and propaganda from the blockading countries toward Qatar. In terms of modalities, this study reveals how bots were used to manipulate Twitter trends, promote fake news, increase the ranking of anti-Qatar tweets from specific political figures, present the illusion of grassroots Qatari opposition to the Tamim regime, and pollute the information sphere around Qatar, thus amplifying propaganda discourses beyond regional and national news channels.","[Jones, Marc Owen] Hamad bin Khalifa Univ, Ar Rayyan, Qatar; [Jones, Marc Owen] Exeter Univ, Exeter, Devon, England",Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; University of Exeter,"Jones, MO (通讯作者)，Hamad bin Khalifa Univ, Ar Rayyan, Qatar.",mojones@hbku.edu.qa,"Jones, Marc/AAB-5008-2019","Jones, Marc/0000-0002-4397-8004",,,,47,9,9,5,20,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

They also develop from scratch a computerized technique that reliably determines the degree of narrativity of 190,461 verbatim, online consumer reviews and validate the automated text analysis with two controlled experiments. More transporting (i.e., engaging) and persuasive reviews have better-developed characters and events as well as more emotionally changing genres and dramatic event orders. This interdisciplinary, multimethod research should help future researchers (1) predict how narrativity affects consumers' narrative transportation and persuasion, (2) measure the narrativity of large digital corpora of textual data, and (3) understand how this important linguistic feature varies along a continuum.","[van Laer, Tom] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Mkt, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England; [Escalas, Jennifer Edson] Vanderbilt Univ, Owen Grad Sch Management, Mkt, 401 21st Ave South, Nashville, TN 37203 USA; [Ludwig, Stephan] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, Mkt, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [van den Hende, Ellis A.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design Engn, Mkt, Landbergstr 15, NL-2628 CE Delft, Netherlands",City University London; Vanderbilt University; University of Melbourne; Delft University of Technology,"van Laer, T (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, Mkt, 106 Bunhill Row, London EC1Y 8TZ, England.",tvanlaer@city.ac.uk; jennifer.escalas@owen.vanderbilt.edu; sludwig@unimelb.edu.au; e.a.vandenhende@tudelft.nl,"van Laer, Tom/AAC-2500-2019","van Laer, Tom/0000-0003-4646-1569; Ludwig, Stephan/0000-0001-5894-6294",Marketing Science Institute [4000118],The Marketing Science Institute financially supported part of this work through research grant 4000118.,,91,39,39,44,192,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0093-5301,1537-5277,,J CONSUM RES,J.

But increasingly, social media has emerged as a fertile soil for deliberately produced misinformation campaigns, conspiracy, and extremist alternative media. How does the sourcing of political news and information define contemporary political communication in different countries in Europe? To understand what users are sharing in their political communication, we analyzed large volumes of political conversation over a major social media platform-in real-time and native languages during campaign periods-for three major European elections. Rather than chasing a definition of what has come to be known as fake news, we produce a grounded typology of what users actually shared and apply rigorous coding and content analysis to define the types of sources, compare them in context with known forms of political news and information, and contrast their circulation patterns in France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. Based on this analysis, we offer a definition of junk news that refers to deliberately produced misleading, deceptive, and incorrect propaganda purporting to be real news. In the first multilingual, cross-national comparison of junk news sourcing and consumption over social media, we analyze over 4 million tweets from three elections and find that (1) users across Europe shared substantial amounts of junk news in varying qualities and quantities, (2) amplifier accounts drive low to medium levels of traffic and news sharing, and (3) Europeans still share large amounts of professionally produced information from media outlets, but other traditional sources of political information including political parties and government agencies are in decline.","[Neudert, Lisa-Maria] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England; [Neudert, Lisa-Maria] Univ Oxford, Project Computat Propaganda, Oxford, England; [Howard, Philip] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Kollanyi, Bence] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford; Corvinus University Budapest,"Howard, P (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",philip.howard@oii.ox.ac.uk,,,European Research Council through the grant Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe [648311],"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded by the European Research Council through the grant Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe, Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

In the results and interpretation sections, we attempt to connect our findings to broader discussions on agenda setting, framing, and building consent. Based on our analysis, we propose the following conclusions: (a) Political affiliation, ownership structure, and the ideological outlook all had unique effects on how a publication covered the Gulf Crisis, (b) the progovernment press embarked on a campaign to sway public opinion about the government's decision to side with Qatar. The dimensions of this campaign strongly resembled an executive act of consent manufacturing, and (c) corporate-owned news organizations were the driving force shaping both the public agenda and the dominant framing of the Gulf Crisis in the Turkish mediascape.","[Furman, Ivo; Saka, Erkan; Yildirim, Savas; Elbeyi, Ece] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Istanbul, Turkey",Istanbul Bilgi University,"Furman, I (通讯作者)，Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",ivo.furman@bilgi.edu.tr; erkan.saka@bilgi.edu.tr; savas.yildirim@bilgi.edu.tr; ece.elbeyi@bilgi.edu.tr,"Saka, Erkan/J-2665-2019; yildirim, savas/AAG-4639-2019; Furman, Ivo/AAU-4076-2021","Saka, Erkan/0000-0002-1845-4129; yildirim, savas/0000-0002-7764-2891; ",,,,51,0,0,0,4,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

The advances in wearable technologies in the last decade are evidenced in a plethora of original articles, patent documentation, and focused systematic reviews. Although technological innovations continuously respond to emerging challenges and technology availability further supports the evolution of CH solutions, the widespread adoption of wearables remains hindered. Objective: This study aimed to scope the scientific literature in the field of pervasive wearable health monitoring in the time interval from January 2010 to February 2019 with respect to four important pillars: technology, safety and security, prescriptive insight, and user-related concerns. The purpose of this study was multifold: identification of (1) trends and milestones that have driven research in wearable technology in the last decade, (2) concerns and barriers from technology and user perspective, and (3) trends in the research literature addressing these issues. Methods: This study followed the scoping review methodology to identify and process the available literature. As the scope surpasses the possibilities of manual search, we relied on the natural language processing tool kit to ensure an efficient and exhaustive search of the literature corpus in three large digital libraries: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, PubMed, and Springer. The search was based on the keywords and properties to be found in articles using the search engines of the digital libraries. Results: The annual number of publications in all segments of research on wearable technology shows an increasing trend from 2010 to February 2019. The technology-related topics dominated in the number of contributions, followed by research on information delivery, safety, and security, whereas user-related concerns were the topic least addressed. The literature corpus evidences milestones in sensor technology (miniaturization and placement), communication architectures and fifth generation (5G) cellular network technology, data analytics, and evolution of cloud and edge computing architectures. The research lag in battery technology makes energy efficiency a relevant consideration in the design of both sensors and network architectures with computational offloading. The most addressed user-related concerns were (technology) acceptance and privacy, whereas research gaps indicate that more efforts should be invested into formalizing clear use cases with timely and valuable feedback and prescriptive recommendations. Conclusions: This study confirms that applications of wearable technology in the CH domain are becoming mature and established as a scientific domain The current research should bring progress to sustainable delivery of valuable recommendations, enforcement of privacy by design, energy-efficient pervasive sensing, seamless monitoring, and low-latency 5G communications. To complement technology achievements, future work involving all stakeholders providing research evidence on improved care pathways and cost-effectiveness of the CH model is needed.","[Loncar-Turukalo, Tatjana] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Zdravevski, Eftim; Trajkovik, Vladimir] Saints Cyril & Methodius Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, Skopje, North Macedonia; [da Silva, Jose Machado] Univ Porto, Inst Syst & Comp Engn Technol & Sci, Fac Engn, Porto, Portugal; [Chouvarda, Ioanna] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Hlth Sci, Thessaloniki, Greece",University of Novi Sad; Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Universidade do Porto; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki,"Loncar-Turukalo, T (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Trg Dositeja Obradovica 6, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",turukalo@uns.ac.rs,"Zdravevski, Eftim/K-5276-2014; Chouvarda, Ioanna/AAV-1500-2020; Machado da Silva, Jose/A-3937-2008","Zdravevski, Eftim/0000-0001-7664-0168; Chouvarda, Ioanna/0000-0001-8915-6658; Machado da Silva, Jose/0000-0002-9160-9158; Loncar-Turukalo, Tatjana/0000-0002-3582-8073; Trajkovik, Vladimir/0000-0001-8103-8059",COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) [ENJECT TD 1405],"This article/publication is based upon work from COST Action ENJECT TD 1405, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology; www.cost.eu).",,94,50,50,11,39,"JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC",TORONTO,"130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",1438-8871,,,J MED INTERNET RES,J.

Therefore, equal access to health information is a global imperative. We studied one specific scenario, in which Google functions as a gatekeeper when people seek suicide-related information using both helpful and harmful suicide-related search terms. To help prevent suicides, Google implemented a suicide-prevention result (SPR) at the very top of such search results. While this effort deserves credit, the present investigation compiled evidence that the SPR is not equally displayed to all users. Using a virtual agent-based testing methodology, a set of 3 studies in 11 countries found that the presentation of the SPR varies depending on where people search for suicide-related information. Language is a key factor explaining these differences. Google's algorithms thereby contribute to a global digital divide in online health-information access with possibly lethal consequences. Higher and globally balanced display frequencies are desirable.","[Scherr, Sebastian] Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Haim, Mario; Arendt, Florian] Univ Munich LMU, Dept Commun Sci & Media Res, Munich, Germany",League of European Research Universities - LERU; KU Leuven; League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Munich,"Scherr, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Sch Mass Commun Res, Pk Str 45, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",sebastian.scherr@kuleuven.be,"Scherr, Sebastian/ABE-5525-2020","Scherr, Sebastian/0000-0003-4730-1575",,,,71,16,17,3,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,MAR,2019,21,3,,,,,562,582,,10.1177/1461444818801010,,,21,Communication,,Communication,HO1AE,WOS:000460636800002,,,,,44661

Firstly, the Levy process and the European option pricing are introduced. Then, we used the characteristic function of Levy process to generate density function value at discrete point in a certain range, based on the saddle-point approximation method. Then, we provide the method to construct recombined multinomial tree and give the pricing formula of European option and path-dependent option pricing based on the backward iteration. Finally, we used the CGMY process to demonstrate its application to European option, American option and American barrier option pricing. It proves that saddle-point approximation turns the inverse Fourier integral transform problem to several function value calculation. Comparing to IFFT, the speed of calculation using this method is faster, and it avoid the negative probability density function value based on IFFT. Because of the linear growth of the number of nodes, we can extend the saddle-point approximation method to the calculation of path-dependent option. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We find that right-wing Australian retweeters are more intense in their news engagement, compared with their left-wing counterparts, whereas in South Korea it was the opposite. Australian right-wing political retweeters have more diverse information sources, while there was no difference in information diversity between the right and left in South Korea.

What factors contribute to the success of a blog and how to predict its success level are questions worth discussing. A hybrid swam intelligence approach is proposed in this study to predict blog success level. First, this study develops a research model of blog success with six factors from content, technology, and social views of point, which include currentness, design, reliability, security, interaction, and connectivity. A questionnaire is designed based on the blog success model. Two hundred ten valid samples are collected from Internet users with experience in using or creating blogs. A hybrid approach combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and self-organizing map (SOM) is proposed to predict blog success level. The results of 10-fold validation are examined to compare the hybrid PSO-SOM approach with the results from three classifiers: C5.0, classification and regression trees (CARTs), and support vector machine (SVM). For blog success prediction, the results indicate the PSO-SOM approach demonstrates higher accuracy among these methods. (c) 2019 The Authors.

Materials and Methods: Eight moderated OHCs were hosted by the National LGBT Cancer Network from 2013 to 2015. Forty-six SMW wrote a total of 885 posts across the OHCs, which were analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and latent Dirichlet allocation. Pearson correlation was calculated between Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count word categories and participant engagement in the OHCs. Latent Dirichlet allocation was used to derive main topics. Results: Participants (average age 46 years; 89% white/non-Hispanic) who used more sadness, female-reference, drives, and religion-related words were more likely to post in the OHCs. Ten topics emerged: coping, holidays and vacation, cancer diagnosis and treatment, structure of day-to-day life, self-care, loved ones, physical recovery, support systems, body image, and symptom management. Coping was the most common topic; symptom management was the least common topic. Discussion: Highly engaged SMW in the OHCs connected to others via their shared female gender identity. Topics discussed in these OHCs were similar to OHCs for heterosexual women, and sexual identity was not a dominant topic. The presence of OHC moderators may have driven participation. Formal comparison between sexual minority and heterosexual women's OHCs are needed. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the experiences of SMW cancer survivors and can inform the development of tailored OHC-based interventions for SMW who are survivors of cancer.","[Lee, Young Ji] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Nursing, Dept Hlth & Community Syst, 3500 Victoria St,420 Victoria Bldg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Lee, Young Ji] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Informat, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Kamen, Charles] Univ Rochester, Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Rochester, NY USA; [Margolies, Liz] Natl LGBT Canc Network, New York, NY USA; [Boehmer, Ulrike] Boston Univ, Dept Community Hlth Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Rochester; Boston University,"Lee, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Nursing, Dept Hlth & Community Syst, 3500 Victoria St,420 Victoria Bldg, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",leeyoung@pitt.edu,,,"National Cancer InstituteUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [K07 CA190529, UG1 CA189961]; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) [K07CA190529, UG1CA189961] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by National Cancer Institute grants K07 CA190529 and UG1 CA189961 (CK).

Current measures requiring patients to self-report limitations are time-consuming and may be considered intrusive by some. This makes widespread classification of patient health literacy challenging. The objective of this study was to develop and validate literacy profiles as automated indicators of patients' health literacy to facilitate a non-intrusive, economic and more comprehensive characterization of health literacy among a health care delivery system's membership. To this end, three literacy profiles were generated based on natural language processing (combining computational linguistics and machine learning) using a sample of 283,216 secure messages sent from 6,941 patients to their primary care physicians. All patients were participants in Kaiser Permanente Northern California's DISTANCE Study. Performance of the three literacy profiles were compared against a gold standard of patient self-reported health literacy. Associations were analyzed between each literacy profile and patient demographics, health outcomes and healthcare utilization. T-tests were used for numeric data such as A1C, Charlson comorbidity index and healthcare utilization rates, and chi-square tests for categorical data such as sex, race, poor adherence and severe hypoglycemia. Literacy profiles varied in their test characteristics, with C-statistics ranging from 0.61-0.74. Relations between literacy profiles and health outcomes revealed patterns consistent with previous health literacy research: patients identified via literacy profiles indicative of limited health literacy: (a) were older and more likely of minority status; (b) had poorer medication adherence and glycemic control; and (c) exhibited higher rates of hypoglycemia, comorbidities and healthcare utilization. This represents the first successful attempt to employ natural language processing to estimate health literacy. Literacy profiles can offer an automated and economical way to identify patients with limited health literacy and greater vulnerability to poor health outcomes.","[Balyan, Renu] Arizona State Univ, Ira A Fulton Sch Engn, Mesa, AZ USA; [Crossley, Scott A.] Georgia State Univ, Coll Arts & Sci, ESL, Dept Appl Linguist, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Brown, William, III; Lyles, Courtney R.; Schillinger, Dean] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, UCSF Ctr Vulnerable Populat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Karter, Andrew J.; Liu, Jennifer Y.; Lyles, Courtney R.; Schillinger, Dean] Kaiser Permanente Northern Calif, Div Res, Oakland, CA USA; [McNamara, Danielle S.] Arizona State Univ, Dept Psychol, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Lyles, Courtney R.; Schillinger, Dean] Zuckerberg San Francisco Gen Hosp & Trauma Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA",Arizona State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Kaiser Permanente; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Schillinger, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Med, UCSF Ctr Vulnerable Populat, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA.; Schillinger, D (通讯作者)，Kaiser Permanente Northern Calif, Div Res, Oakland, CA USA.; Schillinger, D (通讯作者)，Zuckerberg San Francisco Gen Hosp & Trauma Ctr, San Francisco, CA 94110 USA.",dean.schillinger@ucsf.edu,,", Renu/0000-0003-1393-2416","National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [NLM R01 LM012355]; NIDDK Centers for Diabetes Translational Research [P30 DK092924, R01 DK065664]; NICHDUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD) [R01 HD46113]; Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of EducationUS Department of Education [R305A120707, R305A180261]; KPNC; ALT LLC; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Diabetes & Digestive & Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) [P30DK092924] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) [R01LM012355] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work has been supported by grants NLM R01 LM012355 from the National Institutes of Health, NIDDK Centers for Diabetes Translational Research (P30 DK092924), R01 DK065664, NICHD R01 HD46113 and Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, through grants R305A120707 and R305A180261.

The answer to this question has long remained elusive due to a paucity of large-scale data on environmental aesthetics and individual happiness. Here, we draw on two novel datasets: first, individual happiness data from the smartphone app, Mappiness, and second, crowdsourced ratings of the scenicness of photographs taken across England from the online game Scenic-Or-Not. We find that individuals are happier in more scenic locations, even when we account for a range of factors such as the activity the individual was engaged in at the time, weather conditions and the income of local inhabitants. Crucially, this relationship holds not only in natural environments, but in built-up areas too, even after controlling for the presence of green space. Our results provide evidence that the aesthetics of the environments that policymakers choose to build or demolish may have consequences for our everyday wellbeing.","[Seresinhe, Chanuki Illushka; Preis, Tobias; Moat, Helen Susannah] Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Data Sci Lab, Behav Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Seresinhe, Chanuki Illushka; Preis, Tobias; Moat, Helen Susannah] Alan Turing Inst, British Lib, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England; [Preis, Tobias; Moat, Helen Susannah] Boston Univ, Dept Phys, 590 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [MacKerron, George] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Jubilee Bldg, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",University of Warwick; Boston University; University of Sussex,"Seresinhe, CI (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Business Sch, Data Sci Lab, Behav Sci, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.; Seresinhe, CI (通讯作者)，Alan Turing Inst, British Lib, 96 Euston Rd, London NW1 2DB, England.",C.Seresinhe@warwick.ac.uk,"Seresinhe, Chanuki/AAE-1297-2019; Preis, Tobias/A-2874-2009","Seresinhe, Chanuki/0000-0001-6599-1325; Preis, Tobias/0000-0001-9185-0892; Moat, Helen Susannah/0000-0001-8974-9277","Research Councils UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI) [EP/K039830/1]; Alan Turing Institute under the EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/N510129/1, TU/B/000006, TU/B/000008, TU/D/000019]; Warwick Business School Doctoral Scholarship; Economic and Social Research Council UKUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC) [PTA-031-2006-00280]; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/K000128/1]","We thank Andrew Oswald for discussions.

Attribution practices that recognize the journalistic contributions of automation, however, have yet to be standardized. Perceptions of human intervention, the metaphor used to describe the automation algorithm, and the location where the byline for automation is located are all attribution decisions that may impact the credibility or perceived bias of the news products purportedly produced via automation. To that end, an online experiment (N = 601) was conducted to test such possibilities using a 2 (source attribution: machine vs. machine and human) x 3 (attribution metaphor: robot reporter vs. news algorithm vs no metaphor control) x 2 (attribution location: start of article vs. end of article) between subjects design. Results revealed that news purportedly written together by human and automated authors is perceived as less biased than news written solely via automation. As for perceived credibility, news that disclosed the role played by automation at the beginning of the news article was perceived as less credible than news when the byline for automation appeared at the end of the article. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.","[Waddell, T.

A continuation of these tendencies is the gradual introduction of algorithms with the aim to supplement, enhance or replace journalistic work with technology. The apotheosis of this process is automated journalism, although it primarily supplements the established news production. Accompanying controversies raise challenging questions about what and how we know via journalism and how that knowledge is substantiated. In automated journalism, the construction of 'objective' facts and its language game depend not only on the combination of technology and human activity, but also on the separation of technological 'objectivity' and human subjectivity. The process of datafication of the facticity draws from the algorithmic judgment concentrated in the principle of legitimation through an instant and authoritative performance. In this respect, the historical principles of 'objective' journalism are being transformed.","[Vobic, Igor; Golob, Monika Kalin] Univ Ljubljani, Fak Druzbene Vede, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Sikonja, Marko Robnik] Univ Ljubljani, Fak Racunalnistvo Informat, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of Ljubljana,"Vobic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljani, Fak Druzbene Vede, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",igor.vobic@fdv.uni-lj.si; marko.robniksikonja@fri.uni-lj.si; monika.kalin-golob@fdv.uni-lj.si,"Robnik-Šikonja, Marko/AAG-6690-2020","Robnik-Šikonja, Marko/0000-0002-1232-3320",,,,86,0,0,3,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1318-3222,1854-8377,,JAVNOST-PUBLIC,Javnost-Public,44911,2019,26,,,1,,,S41,S61,,10.1080/13183222.2019.1696600,,,21,Communication,,Communication,KA5UV,WOS:000505864500003,,Green Submitted,,,44661,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no consensus on whether and how gender differences should influence the design of digital environments. According to some research, digital environments may be unintentionally designed especially for males as a result of the existing gender biases which risks reproducing gender-polarized culture in a computational field. This study attempts to highlight that females are still being negatively affected by existing gender stereotypes and prescribed gender identities despite relatively equal access and use of computer technology. This qualitative study aims to provide insights about the first-time user experience in a home environment of 16 middle school children in Turkey (8 males - 8 females), aged between 11 and 14 years, with a code learning game named Code Combat. The analysis is supported with complementary quantitative findings. The present study investigates the participants' conceptualizations and opinions toward coding concept and this specific coding game. Further, it explores how existing gender stereotypes and gender biased expectations impact their behaviors and attitudes in the context of game experience. Our results indicated that perceived computer competence and perceived coding difficulty had important effects on the participants' performance relatedly with their gender identity. According to our findings, there are important gender differences to be found in our 9 constructs, namely; perceived computer competence, perceived coding difficulty, identification, perceived game difficulty, perceived success, level of enjoyment, level of anxiety, the likelihood of playing it another time and the likelihood of trying new features.","[Yucer, Yeliz; Rizvanoglu, Kerem] Galatasaray Univ, Fac Commun, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey",Galatasaray University,"Yucer, Y (通讯作者)，Galatasaray Univ, Fac Commun, TR-34349 Istanbul, Turkey.",lizyucel@gmail.com; krizvanoglu@gsu.edu.tr,"Rızvanoğlu, Kerem/AAB-4100-2020","Rızvanoğlu, Kerem/0000-0002-6338-3649; Yucel, Yeliz/0000-0002-4327-3303",,,,109,10,12,8,40,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0747-5632,1873-7692,,COMPUT HUM BEHAV,Comput.

This paper contributes to the small body of knowledge on the first point (domestic automation and opinion manipulation) and presents the first piece of research into the second (international automation and opinion manipulation). Findings are based on an analysis of 1.5 million comments on official political information posts on Weibo and 1.1 million posts using hashtags associated with China and Chinese politics on Twitter. In line with previous research, little evidence of automation was found on Weibo. In contrast, a large amount of automation was found on Twitter. However, contrary to expectations and previous news reports, no evidence was found of pro-Chinese-state automation on Twitter. Automation on Twitter was associated with anti-Chinese-state perspectives and published in simplified Mandarin, presumably aimed at diasporic Chinese and mainland users who ?jump the wall? to access blocked platforms. These users come to Twitter seeking more diverse information and an online public sphere but instead they find an information environment in which a small number of anti-Chinese-state voices are attempting to use automation to dominate discourse. Our understanding of public conversation on Twitter in Mandarin is extremely limited and, thus, this paper advances the understanding of political communication on social media.","[Bolsover, Gillian; Howard, Philip] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England",League of European Research Universities - LERU; University of Oxford,"Bolsover, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, England.",gillianbolsover@gmail.com,,,European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [648311],"The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the European Research Council : 'Computational Propaganda: Investigating the Impact of Algorithms and Bots on Political Discourse in Europe,' Proposal 648311, 2015-2020, Philip N.

Systems of this kind exploit the close relation between lexical knowledge and personality models - such as the well-known Big Five model - to provide information about the author of an input text in a non-intrusive fashion, and at a low cost. Although now a well-established research topic in the field, the computational recognition of personality traits from text still leaves a number of research questions worth further exploration. In particular, this paper attempts to shed light on three main issues: (i) whether we may develop psycholinguistics-motivated models of personality recognition when such knowledge sources are not available for the target language under consideration; (ii) whether the use of psycholinguistic knowledge may be still superior to contemporary word vector representations; and (iii) whether we may infer certain personality facets from a corpus that does not explicitly convey this information. In this paper these issues are dealt with in a series of individual experiments of personality recognition from Facebook text, whose initial results should aid the future development of more robust systems of this kind.","[dos Santos, Wesley R.; Ramos, Ricelli M.

Relying on the similarity between dyadic mediation analysis using structural equation modeling and mediation analysis with ordinary least squares regression, we developed MEDYAD, an easy-to-use computational tool for SPSS, SAS, and R that conducts dyadic mediation analysis with distinguishable dyadic data. MEDYAD implements the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model Extended to Mediation (APIMeM), as well as simpler and more complex dyadic mediation models.

Consumers also take vengeance on brands in public venues. Turning to social network sites (SNSs), it is unclear which is dominant. Here historical Facebook and Twitter eWOM (n = 47,907) is analyzed for a static group of 783 active US consumers. Self-enhancement is found on both SNSs. The majority of eWOM is positive Vengeance was rare, occurring only in 10.3% of all eWOM. eWOM appears to mirror a consumer's non-eWOM sentiment valence across SNSs. In this cross-platform comparison we suggest that SNS affordances alter eWOM creation Facebook has privacy expectations and limits direct brand interactions. Twitter is a public platform with less privacy expectations and a larger customer service component. Here eWOM is more prevalent on Twitter but contrary to our expectations is more positive.","[Vargo, Chris; Gangadharbatla, Harsha; Hopp, Toby] Univ Colorado, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Vargo, C (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Advertising Publ Relat & Media Design, 1511 Univ Ave, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",christopher.vargo@colorado.edu,,,,,,49,5,5,6,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0265-0487,1759-3948,,INT J ADVERT,Int.

Given the negative tenor of coverage of undocumented immigration, and ties between framing and policy views on immigration, how the media frames sanctuary cities is likely to impact public perceptions of these cities and their policies. To assess media coverage of sanctuary policies, we analyzed articles from five national newspapers from 1980 to 2017 with both human content analysis and dictionary-based computational analysis. We find that framing around religion/morality and conflict has decreased, while stories focusing on crime and partisanship have increased.

The study employs computational methods by analyzing over 8 million tweets and 1,350 news stories using topic modeling. Building on the theory of (networked) gatekeeping and Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model, the results show that SNS users follow networked gatekeeping practices by mostly associating fake news references to the alleged bias of MSM. On the other hand, MSM coverage tends to link fake news to SNS's negative role in spreading misinformation. I argue here that there is a networked flak activity on Twitter which is defined as a collective negative response to MSM in order to discipline it, change its tone and editorial stance, or undermine the public's trust in it.","[Al-Rawi, Ahmed] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Burnaby, BC, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Al-Rawi, A (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",aalrawi@sfu.ca,,"Al-Rawi, Ahmed/0000-0001-7336-1550",,,,76,23,23,15,116,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

We measure structural and textual features of conversations such as user output, interaction and information content per message across a wide range of information loads.

Method: We analyzed approximately 1.3 million tweets written by 1,399 Twitter users with self-reported diagnoses of ADHD, comparing their posts with those used by a control set matched by age, gender, and period of activity. Results: Users with ADHD are found to be less agreeable, more open, to post more often, and to use more negations, hedging, and swear words. Posts are suggestive of themes of emotional dysregulation, self-criticism, substance abuse, and exhaustion.

In this paper, we gauge the effects of echo chambers in information spreading phenomena over political communication networks. Mining 12 million Twitter messages, we reconstruct a network in which users interchange opinions related to the impeachment of the former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. We define a continuous political leaning parameter, independent of the network's structure, that allows to quantify the presence of echo chambers in the strongly connected component of the network. These are reflected in two well-separated communities of similar sizes with opposite views of the impeachment process. By means of simple spreading models, we show that the capability of users in propagating the content they produce, measured by the associated spreading capacity, strongly depends on their attitude. Users expressing pro-impeachment leanings are capable to transmit information, on average, to a larger audience than users expressing anti-impeachment leanings. Furthermore, the users' spreading capacity is correlated to the diversity, in terms of political position, of the audience reached. Our method can be exploited to identify the presence of echo chambers and their effects across different contexts and shed light upon the mechanisms allowing to break echo chambers.","[Cota, Wesley; Ferreira, Silvio C.] Univ Fed Vicosa, Dept Fis, Vicosa, MG, Brazil; [Ferreira, Silvio C.] Natl Inst Sci & Technol Complex Syst, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo] Univ Politecn Cataluna, Dept Fis, Barcelona, Spain; [Starnini, Michele] ISI Fdn, Turin, Italy",Universidade Federal de Vicosa; Polytechnic University of Catalonia,"Starnini, M (通讯作者)，ISI Fdn, Turin, Italy.",michele.starnini@gmail.com,"Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo/L-8837-2013; Ferreira, Silvio C/G-1847-2012; Cota, Wesley/D-3198-2018","Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo/0000-0002-4051-6007; Ferreira, Silvio C/0000-0001-7159-2769; Cota, Wesley/0000-0002-8582-1531; starnini, michele/0000-0002-9161-5339",CNPqConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ); FAPEMIGFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); program Ciencia sem Fronteiras-CAPES [88881.030375/2013-01]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior-Brasil (CAPES)Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [001]; J.

Abstract A critical element in understanding voice production mechanisms is the characterization of vocal fold collision, which is widely considered a primary etiological factor in the development of common phonotraumatic lesions such as nodules and polyps. This paper describes the development of a transoral, dual-sensor intraglottal/subglottal pressure probe for the simultaneous measurement of vocal fold collision and subglottal pressures during phonation using two miniature sensors positioned 7.6 mm apart at the distal end of a rigid cannula. Proof-of-concept testing was performed using excised whole-mount and hemilarynx human tissue aerodynamically driven into self-sustained oscillation, with systematic variation of the superior-inferior positioning of the vocal fold collision sensor. In the hemilarynx experiment, signals from the pressure sensors were synchronized with an acoustic microphone, a tracheal-surface accelerometer, and two high-speed video cameras recording at 4000 frames per second for top-down and en face imaging of the superior and medial vocal fold surfaces, respectively. As expected, the intraglottal pressure signal exhibited an impulse-like peak when vocal fold contact occurred, followed by a broader peak associated with intraglottal pressure build-up during the de-contacting phase. As subglottal pressure was increased, the peak amplitude of the collision pressure increased and typically reached a value below that of the average subglottal pressure. Results provide important baseline vocal fold collision pressure data with which computational models of voice production can be developed and in vivo measurements can be referenced.","[Mehta, Daryush D.; Kobler, James B.; Zeitels, Steven M.; Petrillo, Robert H.; Hillman, Robert E.] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Laryngeal Surg & Voice Rehabil, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mehta, Daryush D.; Kobler, James B.; Zeitels, Steven M.; Petrillo, Robert H.; Hillman, Robert E.] Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Mehta, Daryush D.; Kobler, James B.; Zeitels, Steven M.; Hillman, Robert E.] MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Boston, MA 02129 USA; [Mehta, Daryush D.; Hillman, Robert E.] Harvard Med Sch, Div Med Sci, Speech & Hearing Biosci & Technol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Zanartu, Matias] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Dept Elect Engn, Valparaiso 2390123, Chile; [Erath, Byron D.; Motie-Shirazi, Mohsen] Clarkson Univ, Dept Mech & Aeronaut Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA; [Peterson, Sean D.] Univ Waterloo, Dept Mech & Mechatron Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Clarkson University; University of Waterloo,"Mehta, DD (通讯作者)，Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Ctr Laryngeal Surg & Voice Rehabil, Boston, MA 02114 USA.; Mehta, DD (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Boston, MA 02114 USA.; Mehta, DD (通讯作者)，MGH Inst Hlth Profess, Boston, MA 02129 USA.; Mehta, DD (通讯作者)，Harvard Med Sch, Div Med Sci, Speech & Hearing Biosci & Technol, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",mehta.daryush@mgh.harvard.edu; james.kobler@mgh.harvard.edu; zeitels.steven@mgh.harvard.edu; matias.zanartu@usm.c1; berath@clarkson.edu; motiesm@clarkson.edu; peterson@uwaterloo.ca; rhpetrillo@mgh.harvard.edu; hillman.robert@mgh.harvard.edu,"Zañartu, Matías/N-1338-2019; Peterson, Sean/E-1891-2013","Zañartu, Matías/0000-0001-5581-4392; Motie-Shirazi, Mohsen/0000-0002-0168-0330; Peterson, Sean/0000-0001-8746-2491",Voice Health Institute; U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [P50 DC015446]; Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT BASAL Grant) [FB0008],"Funding provided by the Voice Health Institute, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (Grant P50 DC015446 awarded to R.E.H.), and the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICYT BASAL Grant FB0008 awarded to M.Z.).

I argue that to make further progress in these areas journalism studies should establish a design orientation towards journalistic technology, and seek to develop rigorous evaluation criteria and metrics that can help propel both scholarship and practice forward.","[Diakopoulos, Nicholas] Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60201 USA",Northwestern University,"Diakopoulos, N (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Commun Studies, Evanston, IL 60201 USA.",nad@northwestern.edu,,"Diakopoulos, Nicholas/0000-0001-5005-6123",,,,18,14,14,3,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

We combine computational and interpretive methods to examine tweets posted by three global aid agencies-U.S. Agency for International Development, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and the International Committee of the Red Cross-as well as public tweets that mention these agencies (N = similar to 100,000). Results indicate that when an agency (a) replies to or retweets public tweeters, (b) includes publicly oriented hashtags and hyperlinks in its tweets, and (c) tweets about topics that the public is also interested in and tweeting about, the social network that develops around the agency is more interconnected, decentralized, and reciprocal. Our framework can help development institutions build more participatory social networks, with multiple voices helping determine collective goals and strategies of collective action for sustainable social change. We also discuss the theoretical implications and methodological significance of our approach.","[Shahin, Saif] Amer Univ, Sch Commun, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Dai, Zehui] Radford Univ, Sch Commun, Radford, VA 24142 USA",American University,"Shahin, S (通讯作者)，Amer Univ, 4000 Massachusetts Ave Northwest, Washington, DC 20016 USA.",shahin@american.edu,,"Shahin, Saif/0000-0002-7608-7283",,,,51,4,4,0,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

These technologists, in their work with journalists, have to learn about journalistic rules while carrying with them technologys own internal logic. Using field theory and in-depth interviews with leading technological firms in data science and management, this study maps out the principles and practices of the technological field and the pressures and powers it exerts on the journalistic field today. Study findings reveal the extent to which technological firms are able to impose their own logics on the journalistic field and become a potentially transformative force, challenging traditional conceptions of what journalism is.","[Wu, Shangyuan; Tandoc, Edson C., Jr.; Salmon, Charles T.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Wu, SY (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Wee Kim Wee Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore, Singapore.",shanwu@ntu.edu.sg,"Wu, Shangyuan/AAE-4478-2020","Tandoc, Edson/0000-0002-8740-9313",,,,43,14,14,3,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-2786,1751-2794,,JOURNAL PRACT,Journal.
